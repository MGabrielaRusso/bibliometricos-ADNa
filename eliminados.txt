AB  - Advancements in sequencing and laboratory technologies have enabled forensic 
      genetic analysis on increasingly low quality and degraded DNA samples. However, 
      existing computational methods applied to genotyping and imputation for 
      generating DNA profiles from degraded DNA have not been tested for forensic 
      applications. Here we simulated sequencing data of varying qualities-coverage, 
      fragment lengths, and deamination patterns-from forty individuals of diverse 
      genetic ancestries. We used this dataset to test the performance of commonly used 
      genotype and imputation methods (SAMtools, GATK, ATLAS, Beagle, and GLIMPSE) on 
      five different SNP panels (MPS-plex, FORCE, two extended kinship panels, and the 
      Human Origins array) that are used for forensic and population genetics 
      applications. For genome mapping and variant calling with degraded DNA, we find 
      use of parameters and methods (such as ATLAS) developed for ancient DNA analysis 
      provides a marked improvement over conventional standards used for next 
      generation sequencing analysis. We find that ATLAS outperforms GATK and SAMtools, 
      achieving over 90 % genotyping accuracy for the four largest SNP panels with 
      coverages greater than 10X. For lower coverages, decreased concordance rates are 
      correlated with increased rates of heterozygosity. Genotype refinement and 
      imputation improve the accuracy at lower coverages by leveraging population 
      reference data. For all five SNP panels, we find that using a population 
      reference panel representative of worldwide populations (e.g., the 1000 Genomes 
      Project) results in increased genotype accuracies across genetic ancestries, 
      compared to ancestry-matched population reference panels. Importantly, we find 
      that the low SNP density of commonly used forensics SNP panels can impact the 
      reliability and performance of genotype refinement and imputation. This 
      highlights a critical trade-off between enhancing privacy by using panels with 
      fewer SNPs and maintaining the effectiveness of genomic tools. We provide 
      benchmarks and recommendations for analyzing degraded DNA from diverse 
      populations with widely used genomic methods in forensic casework.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of Genome-Wide Hybridization Capture Enrichment for 
      Forensic DNA Profiling of Degraded Bones.
LID - 10.3390/genes16010023 [doi]
LID - 23
AB  - In many human rights and criminal contexts, skeletal remains are often the only 
      available samples, and they present a significant challenge for forensic DNA 
      profiling due to DNA degradation. Ancient DNA methods, particularly capture 
      hybridization enrichment, have been proposed for dealing with severely degraded 
      bones, given their capacity to yield results in ancient remains. 
      BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to test the efficacy of genome-wide 
      capture enrichment on degraded forensic human remains compared to autosomal STRs 
      analysis. METHODS: Six highly degraded human bones from the Spanish Civil War 
      (1936-1939) were quantified with Quantifiler(™) Trio and amplified with 
      GlobalFiler(™). Independently, partially UDG-treated double-stranded DNA 
      libraries were generated and shotgun sequenced to screen for endogenous human DNA 
      content. Subsequently, libraries were enriched with the Twist Bioscience "Twist 
      Ancient DNA" reagent enrichment kit, which had not been previously tested for 
      forensic purposes. RESULTS: The results show that the samples behave similarly 
      with both approaches (well-preserved samples yield good results). However, 
      capture enrichment provides some new relevant insights, suggesting that its 
      implementation in current NGS forensic platforms could be beneficial. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Shotgun results show that the analyzed samples exhibit the same 
      characteristics as ancient DNA samples in terms of DNA fragmentation and 
      molecular damage, which may enhance the value of this approach when 
      authenticating the endogenous DNA of forensic samples.

LID - 10299
AB  - As with all new fields of discovery, work on the biological role of 
      G-quadruplexes (GQs) has produced a number of results that at first glance are 
      quite baffling, sometimes because they do not fit well together, but mostly 
      because they are different from commonly held expectations. Like other classes of 
      flipons, those that form G-quadruplexes have a repeat sequence motif that enables 
      the fold. The canonical DNA motif (G(3)N(1-7))(3)G(3), where N is any nucleotide 
      and G is guanine, is a feature that is under active selection in avian and 
      mammalian genomes. The involvement of G-flipons in genome maintenance traces back 
      to the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans and to ancient DNA repair pathways. 
      The role of GQs in transcription is supported by the observation that yeast Rap1 
      protein binds both B-DNA, in a sequence-specific manner, and GQs, in a 
      structure-specific manner, through the same helix. Other sequence-specific 
      transcription factors (TFs) also engage both conformations to actuate cellular 
      transactions. Noncoding RNAs can also modulate GQ formation in a 
      sequence-specific manner and engage the same cellular machinery as localized by 
      TFs, linking the ancient RNA world with the modern protein world. The coevolution 
      of noncoding RNAs and sequence-specific proteins is supported by studies of early 
      embryonic development, where the transient formation of G-quadruplexes 
      coordinates the epigenetic specification of cell fate.

LID - 10.1111/1556-4029.15482 [doi]
AB  - Genetic assessment of highly incinerated and/or degraded human skeletal material 
      is a persistent challenge in forensic DNA analysis, including identifying victims 
      of mass disasters. Few studies have investigated the impact of thermal 
      degradation on whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) quality and 
      quantity using next-generation sequencing (NGS). We present whole-genome SNP data 
      obtained from the bones and teeth of 27 fire victims using two DNA extraction 
      techniques. Extracts were converted to double-stranded DNA libraries then 
      enriched for whole-genome SNPs using unpublished biotinylated RNA baits and 
      sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 platform. Raw reads were processed using the 
      EAGER (Efficient Ancient Genome Reconstruction) pipeline, and the SNPs filtered 
      and called using FreeBayes and GATK (v. 3.8). Mixed-effects modeling of the data 
      suggest that SNP variability and preservation is predominantly determined by 
      skeletal element and burn category, and not by extraction type. Whole-genome SNP 
      data suggest that selecting long bones, hand and foot bones, and teeth subjected 
      to temperatures <350°C are the most likely sources for higher genomic DNA yields. 
      Furthermore, we observed an inverse correlation between the number of captured 
      SNPs and the extent to which samples were burned, as well as a significant 
      decrease in the total number of SNPs measured for samples subjected to 
      temperatures >350°C. Our data complement previous analyses of burned human 
      remains that compare extraction methods for downstream forensic applications and 
      support the idea of adopting a modified Dabney extraction technique when 
      traditional forensic methods fail to produce DNA yields sufficient for genetic 
      identification.

AB  - Analyses of ancient DNA typically involve sequencing the surviving short 
      oligonucleotides and aligning to genome assemblies from related, modern species. 
      Here, we report that skin from a female woolly mammoth (†Mammuthus primigenius) 
      that died 52,000 years ago retained its ancient genome architecture. We use 
      PaleoHi-C to map chromatin contacts and assemble its genome, yielding 28 
      chromosome-length scaffolds. Chromosome territories, compartments, loops, Barr 
      bodies, and inactive X chromosome (Xi) superdomains persist. The active and 
      inactive genome compartments in mammoth skin more closely resemble Asian elephant 
      skin than other elephant tissues. Our analyses uncover new biology. Differences 
      in compartmentalization reveal genes whose transcription was potentially altered 
      in mammoths vs. elephants. Mammoth Xi has a tetradic architecture, not bipartite 
      like human and mouse. We hypothesize that, shortly after this mammoth's death, 
      the sample spontaneously freeze-dried in the Siberian cold, leading to a glass 
      transition that preserved subfossils of ancient chromosomes at nanometer scale.

AB  - In temperate and subtropical regions, ancient proteins are reported to survive up 
      to about 2 million years, far beyond the known limits of ancient DNA preservation 
      in the same areas. Accordingly, their amino acid sequences currently represent 
      the only source of genetic information available to pursue phylogenetic inference 
      involving species that went extinct too long ago to be amenable for ancient DNA 
      analysis. Here we present a complete workflow, including sample preparation, mass 
      spectrometric data acquisition and computational analysis, to recover and 
      interpret million-year-old dental enamel protein sequences. During sample 
      preparation, the proteolytic digestion step, usually an integral part of 
      conventional bottom-up proteomics, is omitted to increase the recovery of the 
      randomly degraded peptides spontaneously generated by extensive diagenetic 
      hydrolysis of ancient proteins over geological time. Similarly, we describe other 
      solutions we have adopted to (1) authenticate the endogenous origin of the 
      protein traces we identify, (2) detect and validate amino acid variation in the 
      ancient protein sequences and (3) attempt phylogenetic inference. Sample 
      preparation and data acquisition can be completed in 3-4 working days, while 
      subsequent data analysis usually takes 2-5 days. The workflow described requires 
      basic expertise in ancient biomolecules analysis, mass spectrometry-based 
      proteomics and molecular phylogeny. Finally, we describe the limits of this 
      approach and its potential for the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships 
      in paleontology and paleoanthropology.

AB  - The prevalence of COVID-19 critical illness varies across ethnicities, with 
      recent studies suggesting that genetic factors may contribute to this variation. 
      The aim of this study was to investigate natural selection signals of genes 
      associated with critically-ill COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africans. Severe COVID-19 
      SNPs were obtained from the HGI website. Selection signals were assessed in 661 
      sub-Sahara Africans from 1000 Genomes Project using integrated haplotype score 
      (iHS), cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH), and fixation 
      index (Fst). Allele frequency trajectory analysis of ancient DNA samples were 
      used to validate the existing of selection in sub-Sahara Africans. We also used 
      Mendelian randomization to decipher the correlation between natural selection and 
      critically-ill COVID-19. We identified that CCR3 exhibited significant natural 
      selection signals in sub-Sahara Africans. Within the CCR3 gene, rs17217831-A 
      showed both high iHS (Standardized iHS = 2) and high XP-EHH (Standardized XP-EHH 
      = 2.5) in sub-Sahara Africans. Allele frequency trajectory of CCR3 rs17217831-A 
      revealed natural selection occurring in the recent 1,500 years. Natural selection 
      resulted in increased CCR3 expression in sub-Sahara Africans. Mendelian 
      Randomization provided evidence that increased blood CCR3 expression and 
      eosinophil counts lowered the risk of critically ill COVID-19. Our findings 
      suggest that sub-Saharan Africans are resistant to critically ill COVID-19 due to 
      natural selection and identify CCR3 as a potential novel therapeutic target.

TI  - Evaluation of a New DNA Extraction Method on Challenging Bone Samples Recovered 
      from a WWII Mass Grave.

AB  - Bones and teeth represent a common finding in ancient DNA studies and in forensic 
      casework, even after a long burial. Genetic typing is the gold standard for the 
      personal identification of skeletal remains, but there are two main factors 
      involved in the successful DNA typing of such samples: (1) the set-up of an 
      efficient DNA extraction method; (2) the identification of the most suitable 
      skeletal element for the downstream genetic analyses. In this paper, a protocol 
      based on the processing of 0.5 g of bone powder decalcified using Na(2)EDTA 
      proved to be suitable for a semi-automated DNA extraction workflow using the 
      Maxwell(®) FSC DNA IQ™ Casework Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The performance 
      of this method in terms of DNA recovery and quality was compared with a full 
      demineralisation extraction protocol based on Qiagen technology and kits. No 
      statistically significant differences were scored according to the DNA recovery 
      and DNA degradation index (p-values ≥ 0.176; r ≥ 0.907). This new DNA extraction 
      protocol was applied to 88 bone samples (41 femurs, 19 petrous bones, 12 
      metacarpals and 16 molars) allegedly belonging to 27 World War II Italian 
      soldiers found in a mass grave on the isle of Cres (Croatia). The results of the 
      qPCR performed by the Quantifiler Human DNA Quantification kit showed values 
      above the lowest Limit of Quantification (lLOQ; 23 pg/µL) for all petrous bones, 
      whereas other bone types showed, in most cases, lower amounts of DNA. Replicate 
      STR-CE analyses showed successful typing (that is, >12 markers) in all tests on 
      the petrous bones, followed by the metacarpals (83.3%), femurs (52.2%) and teeth 
      (20.0%). Full profiles (22/22 autosomal markers) were achieved mainly in the 
      petrous bones (84.2%), followed by the metacarpals (41.7%). Stochastic 
      amplification artefacts such as drop-outs or drop-ins occurred with a frequency 
      of 1.9% in the petrous bones, whereas they were higher when the DNA recovered 
      from other bone elements was amplified (up to 13.9% in the femurs). Overall, the 
      results of this study confirm that petrous bone outperforms other bone elements 
      in terms of the quantity and quality of the recovered DNA; for this reason, if 
      available, it should always be preferred for genetic testing. In addition, our 
      results highlight the need for accurate planning of the DVI operation, which 
      should be carried out by a multi-disciplinary team, and the tricky issue of 
      identifying other suitable skeletal elements for genetic testing. Overall, the 
      results presented in this paper support the need to adopt preanalytical 
      strategies positively related to the successful genetic testing of aged skeletal 
      remains in order to reduce costs and the time of analysis.

TI  - Ancient and Modern Genomes Reveal Microsatellites Maintain a Dynamic Equilibrium 
      Through Deep Time.
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evae017 [doi]
LID - evae017
AB  - Microsatellites are widely used in population genetics, but their evolutionary 
      dynamics remain poorly understood. It is unclear whether microsatellite loci 
      drift in length over time. This is important because the mutation processes that 
      underlie these important genetic markers are central to the evolutionary models 
      that employ microsatellites. We identify more than 27 million microsatellites 
      using a novel and unique dataset of modern and ancient Adélie penguin genomes 
      along with data from 63 published chordate genomes. We investigate microsatellite 
      evolutionary dynamics over 2 timescales: one based on Adélie penguin samples 
      dating to ∼46.5 ka and the other dating to the diversification of chordates aged 
      more than 500 Ma. We show that the process of microsatellite allele length 
      evolution is at dynamic equilibrium; while there is length polymorphism among 
      individuals, the length distribution for a given locus remains stable. Many 
      microsatellites persist over very long timescales, particularly in exons and 
      regulatory sequences. These often retain length variability, suggesting that they 
      may play a role in maintaining phenotypic variation within populations.

AB  - A frequent source of debate in paleoanthropology concerns the taxonomic unity of 
      fossil assemblages, with many hominin samples exhibiting elevated levels of 
      variation that can be interpreted as indicating the presence of multiple species. 
      By contrast, the large assemblage of hominin fossils from the Rising Star cave 
      system, assigned to Homo naledi, exhibits a remarkably low degree of variation 
      for most skeletal elements. Many factors can contribute to low sample variation, 
      including genetic drift, strong natural selection, biased sex ratios, and 
      sampling of closely related individuals. In this study, we tested for potential 
      sex-biased sampling in the Rising Star dental sample. We compared coefficients of 
      variation for the H. naledi teeth to those for eight extant hominoid samples. We 
      used a resampling procedure that generated samples from the extant taxa that 
      matched the sample size of the fossil sample for each possible Rising Star dental 
      sex ratio. We found that variation at four H. naledi tooth positions-I(2), M(1), 
      P(4), M(1)-is so low that the possibility that one sex is represented by few or 
      no individuals in the sample cannot be excluded. Additional evidence is needed to 
      corroborate this inference, such as ancient DNA or enamel proteome data, and our 
      study design does not address other potential factors that would account for low 
      sample variation. Nevertheless, our results highlight the importance of 
      considering the taphonomic history of a hominin assemblage and suggest that 
      sex-biased sampling is a plausible explanation for the low level of phenotypic 
      variation found in some aspects of the current H. naledi assemblage.

AB  - Whole genome characterizations of crop plants based on ancient DNA have provided 
      unique keys for a better understanding of the evolutionary origins of modern 
      cultivars, the pace and mode of selection underlying their adaptation to new 
      environments and the production of phenotypes of interest. Although forests are 
      among the most biologically rich ecosystems on earth and represent a fundamental 
      resource for human societies, no ancient genome sequences have been generated for 
      trees. This contrasts with the generation of multiple ancient reference genomes 
      for important crops. Here, we sequenced the first ancient tree genomes using two 
      white oak wood remains from Germany dating to the Last Little Ice Age (15th 
      century CE, 7.3× and 4.0×) and one from France dating to the Bronze Age 
      (1700 BCE, 3.4×). We assessed the underlying species and identified one medieval 
      remains as a hybrid between two common oak species (Quercus robur and Q. petraea) 
      and the other two remains as Q. robur. We found that diversity at the global 
      genome level had not changed over time. However, exploratory analyses suggested 
      that a reduction of diversity took place at different time periods. Finally, we 
      determined the timing of leaf unfolding for ancient trees for the first time. The 
      study extends the application of ancient wood beyond the classical proxies of 
      dendroclimatology, dendrochronology, dendroarchaeology and dendroecology, thereby 
      enhancing resolution of inferences on the responses of forest ecosystems to past 
      environmental changes, epidemics and silvicultural practices.

AB  - Natural and human-induced environmental changes deeply affected terrestrial 
      ecosystems throughout the Holocene. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions provide 
      information about the past and allow us to predict/model future scenarios. Among 
      potential records, peat bogs are widely used because they present a precise 
      stratigraphy and act as natural archives of highly diverse organic remains. Over 
      the decades, several techniques have been developed to identify debris occurring 
      in peat, including their morphological description. However, this is strongly 
      constrained by the researcher's ability to distinguish residues at the species 
      level, which typically requires many years of experience. In addition, potential 
      contamination hampers using these techniques to obtain information from organisms 
      such as fungi or bacteria. Environmental DNA metabarcoding and shotgun metagenome 
      sequencing could represent a solution to detect specific groups of organisms 
      without any a priori knowledge of their characteristics and/or to identify 
      organisms that have rarely been considered in previous investigations. Moreover, 
      shotgun metagenomics may allow the identification of bacteria and fungi 
      (including both yeast and filamentous life forms), ensuring discrimination 
      between ancient and modern organisms through the study of deamination/damage 
      patterns. In the present review, we aim to i) present the state-of-the-art 
      methodologies in paleoecological and paleoclimatic studies focusing on peat core 
      analyses, proposing alternative approaches to the classical morphological 
      identification of plant residues, and ii) suggest biomolecular approaches that 
      will allow the use of proxies such as invertebrates, fungi, and bacteria, which 
      are rarely employed in paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

AB  - Reconstructing the spatial evolution of languages can deepen our understanding of 
      the demic diffusion and cultural spread. However, the phylogeographic approach 
      that is frequently used to infer language dispersal patterns has limitations, 
      primarily because the phylogenetic tree cannot fully explain the language 
      evolution induced by the horizontal contact among languages, such as borrowing 
      and areal diffusion. Here, we introduce the language velocity field estimation, 
      which does not rely on the phylogenetic tree, to infer language dispersal 
      trajectories and centre. Its effectiveness and robustness are verified through 
      both simulated and empirical validations. Using language velocity field 
      estimation, we infer the dispersal patterns of four agricultural language 
      families and groups, encompassing approximately 700 language samples. Our results 
      show that the dispersal trajectories of these languages are primarily compatible 
      with population movement routes inferred from ancient DNA and archaeological 
      materials, and their dispersal centres are geographically proximate to ancient 
      homelands of agricultural or Neolithic cultures. Our findings highlight that the 
      agricultural languages dispersed alongside the demic diffusions and cultural 
      spreads during the past 10,000 years. We expect that language velocity field 
      estimation could aid the spatial analysis of language evolution and further 
      branch out into the studies of demographic and cultural dynamics.

TI  - Population genomics of the muskox' resilience in the near absence of genetic 
      variation.
PG  - e17205
LID - 10.1111/mec.17205 [doi]
AB  - Genomic studies of species threatened by extinction are providing crucial 
      information about evolutionary mechanisms and genetic consequences of population 
      declines and bottlenecks. However, to understand how species avoid the extinction 
      vortex, insights can be drawn by studying species that thrive despite past 
      declines. Here, we studied the population genomics of the muskox (Ovibos 
      moschatus), an Ice Age relict that was at the brink of extinction for thousands 
      of years at the end of the Pleistocene yet appears to be thriving today. We 
      analysed 108 whole genomes, including present-day individuals representing the 
      current native range of both muskox subspecies, the white-faced and the 
      barren-ground muskox (O. moschatus wardi and O. moschatus moschatus) and a 
      ~21,000-year-old ancient individual from Siberia. We found that the muskox' 
      demographic history was profoundly shaped by past climate changes and 
      post-glacial re-colonizations. In particular, the white-faced muskox has the 
      lowest genome-wide heterozygosity recorded in an ungulate. Yet, there is no 
      evidence of inbreeding depression in native muskox populations. We hypothesize 
      that this can be explained by the effect of long-term gradual population declines 
      that allowed for purging of strongly deleterious mutations. This study provides 
      insights into how species with a history of population bottlenecks, small 
      population sizes and low genetic diversity survive against all odds.

AB  - European bison (Bison bonasus) were widespread throughout Europe during the late 
      Pleistocene. However, the contributions of environmental change and humans to 
      their near extinction have never been resolved. Using process-explicit models, 
      fossils and ancient DNA, we disentangle the combinations of threatening processes 
      that drove population declines and regional extinctions of European bison through 
      space and across time. We show that the population size of European bison 
      declined abruptly at the termination of the Pleistocene in response to rapid 
      environmental change, hunting by humans and their interaction. Human activities 
      prevented populations of European bison from rebounding in the Holocene, despite 
      improved environmental conditions. Hunting caused range loss in the north and 
      east of its distribution, while land use change was responsible for losses in the 
      west and south. Advances in hunting technologies from 1500 CE were needed to 
      simulate low abundances observed in 1870 CE. While our findings show that humans 
      were an important driver of the extinction of the European bison in the wild, 
      vast areas of its range vanished during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition 
      because of post-glacial environmental change. These areas of its former range 
      have been climatically unsuitable for millennia and should not be considered in 
      reintroduction efforts.

AB  - Lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) have been subject to multiple 
      environmental pressures from rapid climate change and intensified human activity 
      in recent decades. However, their ecological effects on the lake ecosystem remain 
      largely unclear due to the lack of long-term monitoring data. This study 
      presented the environmental and ecological changes of the lake Yamzhog Yumco 
      (Southern QTP) over the past three decades based on multi-proxy analysis 
      (geochemistry and sedaDNA) on a high-time resolution sediment core. The result 
      showed that the lake exhibited a continuous eutrophication process from 2004 CE, 
      which has accelerated since 2014 CE. The nutrient enrichment was mainly 
      attributed to anthropogenic emissions from the catchment. The sedimentary ancient 
      DNA (sedaDNA) metabarcoding data registered a sensitive response of aquatic 
      communities to the additional nutrient supply. Eukaryotic algae and aquatic 
      invertebrate communities exhibited similar temporal dynamics, characterized by 
      the increase in eutrophic taxa and the decrease in oligotrophic taxa. Change 
      points analysis suggested that lake ecosystems underwent a slight ecological 
      shift in 2003 CE and an abrupt shift in 2012 CE driven by nutrient enrichment. 
      Quantitative analysis revealed that nutrients and human activity accounted for 
      27.9 % and 21.7 % of the temporal variation in aquatic communities, whereas 
      climate change only explained 6.9 % of the total variation. From a 
      paleolimnological view, our study supported that regional human activity could 
      distinctly alter the nutrient level and aquatic community structure of lake 
      ecosystems in the QTP. Considering that anthropogenic disturbance will 
      continuously increase, it is crucial to strengthen the field monitoring of the 
      lakes on the plateau and make effective management measures to avoid irreversible 
      ecological consequences.

TI  - Ancestry testing of "Old Tom," a killer whale central to mutualistic interactions 
      with human whalers.
PG  - 598-611
LID - 10.1093/jhered/esad058 [doi]
AB  - Cooperative hunting between humans and killer whales (Orcinus orca) targeting 
      baleen whales was reported in Eden, New South Wales, Australia, for almost a 
      century. By 1928, whaling operations had ceased, and local killer whale sightings 
      became scarce. A killer whale from the group, known as "Old Tom," washed up dead 
      in 1930 and his skeleton was preserved. How these killer whales from Eden relate 
      to other populations globally and whether their genetic descendants persist today 
      remains unknown. We extracted and sequenced DNA from Old Tom using ancient DNA 
      techniques. Genomic sequences were then compared with a global dataset of 
      mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Old Tom shared a most recent common ancestor 
      with killer whales from Australasia, the North Atlantic, and the North Pacific, 
      having the highest genetic similarity with contemporary New Zealand killer 
      whales. However, much of the variation found in Old Tom's genome was not shared 
      with these widespread populations, suggesting ancestral rather than ongoing gene 
      flow. Our genetic comparisons also failed to find any clear descendants of Tom, 
      raising the possibility of local extinction of this group. We integrated 
      Traditional Custodian knowledge to recapture the events in Eden and recognize 
      that Indigenous Australians initiated the relationship with the killer whales 
      before European colonization and the advent of commercial whaling locally. This 
      study rectifies discrepancies in local records and provides new insight into the 
      origins of the killer whales in Eden and the history of Australasian killer 
      whales.

AB  - Domestic cats were derived from the Near Eastern wildcat (Felis lybica), after 
      which they dispersed with people into Europe. As they did so, it is possible that 
      they interbred with the indigenous population of European wildcats (Felis 
      silvestris). Gene flow between incoming domestic animals and closely related 
      indigenous wild species has been previously demonstrated in other taxa, including 
      pigs, sheep, goats, bees, chickens, and cattle. In the case of cats, a lack of 
      nuclear, genome-wide data, particularly from Near Eastern wildcats, has made it 
      difficult to either detect or quantify this possibility. To address these issues, 
      we generated 75 ancient mitochondrial genomes, 14 ancient nuclear genomes, and 31 
      modern nuclear genomes from European and Near Eastern wildcats. Our results 
      demonstrate that despite cohabitating for at least 2,000 years on the European 
      mainland and in Britain, most modern domestic cats possessed less than 10% of 
      their ancestry from European wildcats, and ancient European wildcats possessed 
      little to no ancestry from domestic cats. The antiquity and strength of this 
      reproductive isolation between introduced domestic cats and local wildcats was 
      likely the result of behavioral and ecological differences. Intriguingly, this 
      long-lasting reproductive isolation is currently being eroded in parts of the 
      species' distribution as a result of anthropogenic activities.

AB  - Herbarium collections are an important source of dated, identified and preserved 
      DNA, whose use in comparative genomics and phylogeography can shed light on the 
      emergence and evolutionary history of plant pathogens. Here, we reconstruct 13 
      historical genomes of the bacterial crop pathogen Xanthomonas citri pv. citri 
      (Xci) from infected Citrus herbarium specimens. Following authentication based on 
      ancient DNA damage patterns, we compare them with a large set of modern genomes 
      to estimate their phylogenetic relationships, pathogenicity-associated gene 
      content and several evolutionary parameters. Our results indicate that Xci 
      originated in Southern Asia ~11,500 years ago (perhaps in relation to Neolithic 
      climate change and the development of agriculture) and diversified during the 
      beginning of the 13th century, after Citrus diversification and before spreading 
      to the rest of the world (probably via human-driven expansion of citriculture 
      through early East-West trade and colonization).

TI  - Novel Sources of Biodiversity and Biomolecules from Bacteria Isolated from a High 
      Middle Ages Soil Sample in Palermo (Sicily, Italy).
PG  - e0437422
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.04374-22 [doi]
LID - e04374-22
AB  - The urban plan of Palermo (Sicily, Italy) has evolved throughout Punic, Roman, 
      Byzantine, Arab, and Norman ages until it stabilized within the borders that 
      correspond to the current historic center. During the 2012 to 2013 excavation 
      campaign, new remains of the Arab settlement, directly implanted above the 
      structures of the Roman age, were found. The materials investigated in this study 
      derived from the so-called Survey No 3, which consists of a rock cavity of 
      subcylindrical shape covered with calcarenite blocks: it was probably used to 
      dispose of garbage during the Arabic age and its content, derived from daily 
      activities, included grape seeds, scales and bones of fish, small animal bones, 
      and charcoals. Radiocarbon dating confirmed the medieval origin of this site. The 
      composition of the bacterial community was characterized through a 
      culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach. Culturable bacteria were 
      isolated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and the total bacterial community 
      was characterized through metagenomic sequencing. Bacterial isolates were tested 
      for the production of compounds with antibiotic activity: a Streptomyces strain, 
      whose genome was sequenced, was of particular interest because of its inhibitory 
      activity, which was due to the Type I polyketide aureothin. Moreover, all strains 
      were tested for the production of secreted proteases, with those belonging to the 
      genus Nocardioides having the most active enzymes. Finally, protocols commonly 
      used for ancient DNA studies were applied to evaluate the antiquity of isolated 
      bacterial strains. Altogether these results show how paleomicrobiology might 
      represent an innovative and unexplored source of novel biodiversity and new 
      biotechnological tools. IMPORTANCE One of the goals of paleomicrobiology is the 
      characterization of the microbial community present in archaeological sites. 
      These analyses can usually provide valuable information about past events, such 
      as occurrence of human and animal infectious diseases, ancient human activities, 
      and environmental changes. However, in this work, investigations about the 
      composition of the bacterial community of an ancient soil sample (harvested in 
      Palermo, Italy) were carried out aiming to screen ancient culturable strains with 
      biotechnological potential, such as the ability to produce bioactive molecules 
      and secreted hydrolytic enzymes. Besides showing the biotechnological relevance 
      of paleomicrobiology, this work reports a case of germination of putatively 
      ancient bacterial spores recovered from soil rather than extreme environments. 
      Moreover, in the case of spore-forming species, these results raise questions 
      about the accuracy of techniques usually applied to estimate antiquity of DNA, as 
      they could lead to its underestimation.

TI  - Ancient Mitogenomes Reveal Stable Genetic Continuity of the Holocene Serows.
LID - 10.3390/genes14061187 [doi]

AB  - As one of the remaining species of Caprinae only found in Asia, serows 
      (Capricornis) and their classification and conservation have received increasing 
      attention in recent years. However, their evolutionary history and population 
      dynamics are not yet clear. To shed light on these topics, we report the first 
      near-complete ancient mitochondrial genomes from two serow sub-fossils (CADG839 
      and CADG946) dating to 8860 ± 30 years and 2450 ± 30 years, and incorporate the 
      newly obtained mitogenomes into the dataset of living serows (18 complete 
      mitochondrial genomes drawn from National Center for Biotechnology Information, 
      NCBI) to investigate their relationships and evolution. Phylogenetic results 
      support four clades of serows that can be further divided into five subclades, 
      indicating higher genetic diversity than previously thought. Notably, our two 
      ancient samples do not form a separate branch but belong to Capricornis 
      sumatraensis clade A together with modern individuals, which suggests genetic 
      continuity between ancient and modern serows. Furthermore, our results suggest 
      that the maternal divergences of serows occurred at the beginning of the 
      Pleistocene. Bayesian estimation indicates that the first divergence among all 
      serows happened approximately 2.37 Ma (95% highest posterior density, HPD: 
      2.74-2.02 Ma) when Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus) appeared, while the last 
      divergence occurred within the Sumatran serow (C. sumatraensis clade A and B) 
      around 0.37-0.25 Ma. Additionally, we found the effective maternal population 
      size of C. sumatraensis increased around 225-160 and 90-50 ka, then remained 
      stable since 50 ka. Overall, our study provides new insights into serow phylogeny 
      and evolutionary history.

TI  - Solving the two-decades-old murder case through joint application of ZooMS and 
      ancient DNA approaches.

AB  - Bones are one of the most common biological types of evidence in forensic cases. 
      Discriminating human bones from irrelevant species is important for the 
      identification of victims; however, the highly degraded bones could be 
      undiagnostic morphologically and difficult to analyze with standard DNA profiling 
      approaches. The same challenge also exists in archaeological studies. Here, we 
      present an initial study of an analytical strategy that involves zooarchaeology 
      by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) and ancient DNA methods. Through the combined 
      strategy, we managed to identify the only biological evidence of a 
      two-decades-old murder case - a small piece of human bone out of 19 bone 
      fragments - and confirmed the kinship between the victim and the putative parents 
      through joint application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger 
      sequencing methods. ZooMS effectively screened out the target human bone while 
      ancient DNA methods improve the DNA yields. The combined strategy in this case 
      outperforms the standard DNA profiling approach with shorter time, less cost, as 
      well as higher reliability for the genetic identification results. HIGHLIGHTS: • 
      The first application of zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry technique in the 
      forensic case for screening out human bones from bone fragment mixtures. • 
      Application of ancient DNA technique to recover the highly degraded DNA sequence 
      from the challenging sample that failed standard DNA profiling approaches. • A 
      fast, sensitive, and low-cost strategy that combines the strengths of protein 
      analysis and DNA analysis for kinship identification in forensic research.

AB  - Massively parallel sequencing can provide genetic data for hundreds to thousands 
      of loci in a single assay for various types of forensic testing. However, 
      available commercial kits require an initial PCR amplification of short-to-medium 
      sized targets which limits their application for highly degraded DNA. Development 
      and optimisation of large PCR multiplexes also prevents creation of custom panels 
      that target different suites of markers for identity, biogeographic ancestry, 
      phenotype, and lineage markers (Y-chromosome and mtDNA). Hybridisation 
      enrichment, an alternative approach for target enrichment prior to sequencing, 
      uses biotinylated probes to bind to target DNA and has proven successful on 
      degraded and ancient DNA. We developed a customisable hybridisation capture 
      method, that uses individually mixed baits to allow tailored and targeted 
      enrichment to specific forensic questions of interest. To allow collection of 
      forensic intelligence data, we assembled and tested a custom panel of 
      hybridisation baits to infer biogeographic ancestry, hair and eye colour, and 
      paternal lineage (and sex) on modern male and female samples with a range of 
      self-declared ancestries and hair/eye colour combinations. The panel correctly 
      estimated biogeographic ancestry in 9/12 samples (75%) but detected European 
      admixture in three individuals from regions with admixed demographic history. 
      Hair and eye colour were predicted correctly in 83% and 92% of samples 
      respectively, where intermediate eye colour and blond hair were problematic to 
      predict. Analysis of Y-chromosome SNPs correctly assigned sex and paternal 
      haplogroups, the latter complementing and supporting biogeographic ancestry 
      predictions. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of this hybridisation enrichment 
      approach to forensic intelligence testing using a combined suite of biogeographic 
      ancestry, phenotype, and Y-chromosome SNPs for comprehensive biological 
      profiling.

AB  - The Anthropocene is characterized by dramatic ecosystem changes driven by human 
      activities. The impact of these activities can be assessed by different 
      geochemical and paleontological proxies. However, each of these proxies provides 
      only a fragmentary insight into the effects of anthropogenic impacts. It is 
      highly challenging to reconstruct, with a holistic view, the state of the 
      ecosystems from the preindustrial period to the present day, covering all 
      biological components, from prokaryotes to multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we 
      used sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) archives encompassing all trophic levels 
      of biodiversity to reconstruct the two century-natural history in 
      Bagnoli-Coroglio (Gulf of Pozzuoli, Tyrrhenian Sea), one of the most polluted 
      marine-coastal sites in Europe. The site was characterized by seagrass meadows 
      and high eukaryotic diversity until the beginning of the 20th century. Then, the 
      ecosystem completely changed, with seagrasses and associated fauna as well as 
      diverse groups of planktonic and benthic protists being replaced by low diversity 
      biota dominated by dinophyceans and infaunal metazoan species. The sedaDNA 
      analysis revealed a five-phase evolution of the area, where changes appear as the 
      result of a multi-level cascade effect of impacts associated with industrial 
      activities, urbanization, water circulation and land-use changes. The sedaDNA 
      allowed to infer reference conditions that must be considered when restoration 
      actions are to be implemented.

AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater systems are a global threat to human and 
      aquatic ecosystem health, exhibiting particularly harmful effects when 
      toxin-producing taxa are present. While climatic change and nutrient 
      over-enrichment control the global expansion of total cyanobacterial blooms, it 
      remains unknown to what extent this expansion reflected cyanobacterial assemblage 
      due to the scarcity of long-term monitoring data. Here we use high-throughput 
      sequencing of sedimentary DNA to track ∼100 years of changes in cyanobacterial 
      community in hyper-eutrophic Lake Taihu, China's third largest freshwater lake 
      and the key water source for ∼30 million people. A steady increase in the 
      abundance of Microcystis (as potential toxin producers) during the past thirty 
      years was correlated with increasing temperatures and declining wind speeds, but 
      not with temporal trends in lakewater nutrient concentrations, highlighting 
      recent climate effects on potentially increasing toxin-producing taxa. The 
      socio-environmental repercussions of these findings are worrisome as continued 
      anthropogenic climate change may counteract nutrient amelioration efforts in this 
      critical freshwater resource.

AB  - Sedimentary DNA-based studies revealed the effects of human activity on lake 
      cyanobacteria communities over the last centuries, yet we continue to lack 
      information over longer timescales. Here, we apply high-resolution molecular 
      analyses on sedimentary ancient DNA to reconstruct the history of cyanobacteria 
      throughout the Holocene in a lake in north-eastern Germany. We find a substantial 
      increase in cyanobacteria abundance coinciding with deforestation during the 
      early Bronze Age around 4000 years ago, suggesting increased nutrient supply to 
      the lake by local communities settling on the lakeshore. The next substantial 
      human-driven increase in cyanobacteria abundance occurred only about a century 
      ago due to intensified agricultural fertilisation which caused the dominance of 
      potentially toxic taxa (e.g., Aphanizomenon). Our study provides evidence that 
      humans began to locally impact lake ecology much earlier than previously assumed. 
      Consequently, managing aquatic systems today requires awareness of the legacy of 
      human influence dating back potentially several millennia.

TI  - Reassessment of the human mandible from Banyoles (Girona, Spain).
PG  - 103291

AB  - Since the discovery of a human mandible in 1887 near the present-day city of 
      Banyoles, northeastern Spain, researchers have generally emphasized its archaic 
      features, including the lack of chin structures, and suggested affinities with 
      the Neandertals or European Middle Pleistocene (Chibanian) specimens. 
      Uranium-series and electron spin resonance dating suggest the mandible dates to 
      the Late Pleistocene (Tarantian), approximately ca. 45-66 ka. In this study, we 
      reassessed the taxonomic affinities of the Banyoles mandible by comparing it to 
      samples of Middle Pleistocene fossils from Africa and Europe, Neandertals, Early 
      and Upper Paleolithic modern humans, and recent modern humans. We evaluated the 
      frequencies and expressions of morphological features and performed a 
      three-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis on a virtual reconstruction of 
      Banyoles to capture overall mandibular shape. Our results revealed no derived 
      Neandertal morphological features in Banyoles. While a principal component 
      analysis based on Euclidean distances from the first two principal components 
      clearly grouped Banyoles with both fossil and recent Homo sapiens individuals, an 
      analysis of the Procrustes residuals demonstrated that Banyoles did not fit into 
      any of the comparative groups. The lack of Neandertal features in Banyoles is 
      surprising considering its Late Pleistocene age. A consideration of the Middle 
      Pleistocene fossil record in Europe and southwest Asia suggests that Banyoles is 
      unlikely to represent a late-surviving Middle Pleistocene population. The lack of 
      chin structures also complicates an assignment to H. sapiens, although early 
      fossil H. sapiens do show somewhat variable development of the chin structures. 
      Thus, Banyoles represents a non-Neandertal Late Pleistocene European individual 
      and highlights the continuing signal of diversity in the hominin fossil record. 
      The present situation makes Banyoles a prime candidate for ancient DNA or 
      proteomic analyses, which may shed additional light on its taxonomic affinities.

AB  - As evidenced by the large number of articles recently published in the 
      literature, forensic scientists are making great efforts to infer externally 
      visible features and biogeographical ancestry (BGA) from DNA analysis. Just as 
      phenotypic, ancestry information obtained from DNA can provide investigative 
      leads to identify the victims (missing/unidentified persons, crime/armed 
      conflict/mass disaster victims) or trace their perpetrators when no matches were 
      found with the reference profile or in the database. Recently, the advent of 
      Massively Parallel Sequencing technologies associated with the possibility of 
      harnessing high-throughput genetic data allowed us to investigate the 
      associations between phenotypic and genomic variations in worldwide human 
      populations and develop new BGA forensic tools capable of simultaneously 
      analyzing up to millions of markers if for example the ancient DNA approach of 
      hybridization capture was adopted to target SNPs of interest. In the present 
      study, a selection of more than 3000 SNPs was performed to create a new BGA panel 
      and the accuracy of the new panel to infer ancestry from unknown samples was 
      evaluated by the PLS-DA method. Subsequently, the panel created was assessed 
      using three variable selection techniques (Backward variable elimination, Genetic 
      Algorithm and Regularized elimination procedure), and the best SNPs in terms of 
      inferring bio-geographical ancestry at inter- and intra-continental level were 
      selected to obtain panels to predict BGA with a reduced number of selected 
      markers to be applied in routine forensic cases where PCR amplification is the 
      best choice to target SNPs.

TI  - Loss of Mitochondrial Genetic Diversity despite Population Growth: The Legacy of 
      Past Wolf Population Declines.
LID - 10.3390/genes14010075 [doi]
LID - 75
AB  - Gray wolves (Canis lupus) in the Iberian Peninsula declined substantially in both 
      range and population size in the last few centuries due to human persecution and 
      habitat fragmentation. However, unlike many other western European populations, 
      gray wolves never went extinct in Iberia. Since the minimum number was recorded 
      around 1970, their numbers have significantly increased and then stabilized in 
      recent decades. We analyzed mitochondrial genomes from 54 historical specimens of 
      Iberian wolves from across their historical range using ancient DNA methods. We 
      compared historical and current mitochondrial diversity in Iberian wolves at the 
      5' end of the control region (n = 17 and 27) and the whole mitochondrial genome 
      excluding the control region (n = 19 and 29). Despite an increase in population 
      size since the 1970s, genetic diversity declined. We identified 10 whole 
      mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in 19 historical specimens, whereas only six of them 
      were observed in 29 modern Iberian wolves. Moreover, a haplotype that was 
      restricted to the southern part of the distribution has gone extinct. Our results 
      illustrate a lag between demographic and genetic diversity changes, and show that 
      after severe population declines, genetic diversity can continue to be lost in 
      stable or even expanding populations. This suggests that such populations may be 
      of conservation concern even after their demographic trajectory has been 
      reversed.

TI  - Blue Turns to Gray: Paleogenomic Insights into the Evolutionary History and 
      Extinction of the Blue Antelope (Hippotragus leucophaeus).
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msac241 [doi]
LID - msac241
AB  - The blue antelope (Hippotragus leucophaeus) is the only large African mammal 
      species to have become extinct in historical times, yet no nuclear genomic 
      information is available for this species. A recent study showed that many 
      alleged blue antelope museum specimens are either roan (Hippotragus equinus) or 
      sable (Hippotragus niger) antelopes, further reducing the possibilities for 
      obtaining genomic information for this extinct species. While the blue antelope 
      has a rich fossil record from South Africa, climatic conditions in the region are 
      generally unfavorable to the preservation of ancient DNA. Nevertheless, we 
      recovered two blue antelope draft genomes, one at 3.4× mean coverage from a 
      historical specimen (∼200 years old) and one at 2.1× mean coverage from a fossil 
      specimen dating to 9,800-9,300 cal years BP, making it currently the oldest 
      paleogenome from Africa. Phylogenomic analyses show that blue and sable antelope 
      are sister species, confirming previous mitogenomic results, and demonstrate 
      ancient gene flow from roan into blue antelope. We show that blue antelope 
      genomic diversity was much lower than in roan and sable antelope, indicative of a 
      low population size since at least the early Holocene. This supports observations 
      from the fossil record documenting major decreases in the abundance of blue 
      antelope after the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Finally, the persistence of 
      this species throughout the Holocene despite low population size suggests that 
      colonial-era human impact was likely the decisive factor in the blue antelope's 
      extinction.

AB  - The distribution and movement of species, broadly known as biogeography, is one 
      of the fundamental subfields of ecology and evolutionary biology. However, 
      significant mysteries remain about the processes that gave rise to the modern 
      distribution of biodiversity across the globe. Over the last several decades, the 
      genetic study of ancient and subfossil specimens has started to shed light on 
      past migrations of some species, with a particular focus on humans and megafauna. 
      In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Salis et al. (2021) use ancient mitogenomes 
      and a new phylogeographic method to add an important new piece of evidence to the 
      mystery of megafaunal migrations into North America during the Pleistocene. They 
      found a striking synchronicity of brown bear (Ursus arctos) and lion (Panthera 
      spp.) migrations across the Bering Land Bridge at several time points during the 
      late Pleistocene, which highlights the lasting impact of sea level change on the 
      prehistoric and modern dispersal of terrestrial carnivores across continents.

AB  - In forensic crime scene investigations, biological fluids such as blood are 
      commonly found in soil. However, the analysis of blood-stained soil can be 
      challenging due to the presence of inhibitors which limit the effective 
      extraction and amplification of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) required to 
      produce a reportable DNA profile. There are some extraction methods that have 
      been applied to blood-stained soil in forensic science, but these have produced 
      sporadic results. This research has taken a number of different extraction 
      methods from the fields of ancient DNA and environmental DNA and broken them down 
      into the individual steps of pre-treatment, incubation, separation and 
      purification. These steps were assessed independently then combined into various 
      extraction methods to determine the best technique that can effectively and 
      reliably profile human DNA from blood-stained soil. Testing involved assessment 
      of three extraction buffers, (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, guanidine 
      thiocyanate, and proteinase K), four pre-treatment methods, 
      (polyvinylpyrrolidone, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and 
      sodium hydroxide), three separation steps, (centrifugation, phenol chloroform, 
      and chloroform) and four purification steps, (size exclusion chromatography, bind 
      elute columns, isopropanol precipitation and silica magnetic beads). The most 
      effective procedure was found to be a polyvinylpyrrolidone pre-treatment with a 
      proteinase K extraction buffer followed by magnetic silica bead purification with 
      or without centrifugation. However, centrifugation separation was found to be 
      equally effective after the pre-treatment step as after the incubation step. Our 
      results shows that most of the current forensic procedures would benefit from the 
      addition of a pre-treatment step prior to processing through the automated DNA 
      profiling pipeline.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to quantify the presence and prevalence of specific 
      genetic and infectious diseases in the pre-Colombian Panamanian population and 
      uses these data to consider the plausibility of these diseases as causative 
      factors in the development of an abnormal supernumerary cusp morphology in a 
      1500-year-old isolated molar recovered from Cerro Juan Díaz (Los Santos, Panama). 
      MATERIALS: 267 individuals from pre-Columbian sites throughout Panama. METHODS: 
      The anomalous tooth was analyzed through macroscopic, odontometric, and 
      radiographic means. Tentative differential diagnosis was performed using 
      inferences from paleopathological features of the broader regional population. 
      RESULTS: The regional sample showed evidence of treponemal infection and 
      developmental anomalies in 10.1% and 10.9% of individuals, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: While not able to rule out three potential genetic conditions, more 
      evidence was found to support the differential diagnosis of congenital syphilis 
      as the causative agent leading to the development of abnormal supernumerary cusps 
      in the isolated molar. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates how characterizing 
      disease experience in the population can assist in differential diagnoses at the 
      individual level and cautions against the assumption that any one lesion in 
      isolation is unique to only one specific pathological condition. LIMITATIONS: The 
      timing discrepancy between clinical descriptions of congenital syphilis and 
      genetic disorders, lack of knowledge on pathophysiological mechanisms of the 
      former, poor preservation of Treponema pathogen ancient DNA, and deficiencies in 
      modern public health data from Panama limit the differential diagnosis. 
      SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Inclusion and serious contemplation of genetic 
      diseases in paleopathological differential diagnoses is necessary.

TI  - Lions and brown bears colonized North America in multiple synchronous waves of 
      dispersal across the Bering Land Bridge.
PG  - 6407-6421

AB  - The Bering Land Bridge connecting North America and Eurasia was periodically 
      exposed and inundated by oscillating sea levels during the Pleistocene glacial 
      cycles. This land connection allowed the intermittent dispersal of animals, 
      including humans, between Western Beringia (far northeast Asia) and Eastern 
      Beringia (northwest North America), changing the faunal community composition of 
      both continents. The Pleistocene glacial cycles also had profound impacts on 
      temperature, precipitation and vegetation, impacting faunal community structure 
      and demography. While these palaeoenvironmental impacts have been studied in many 
      large herbivores from Beringia (e.g., bison, mammoths, horses), the Pleistocene 
      population dynamics of the diverse guild of carnivorans present in the region are 
      less well understood, due to their lower abundances. In this study, we analyse 
      mitochondrial genome data from ancient brown bears (Ursus arctos; n = 103) and 
      lions (Panthera spp.; n = 39), two megafaunal carnivorans that dispersed into 
      North America during the Pleistocene. Our results reveal striking synchronicity 
      in the population dynamics of Beringian lions and brown bears, with multiple 
      waves of dispersal across the Bering Land Bridge coinciding with glacial periods 
      of low sea levels, as well as synchronous local extinctions in Eastern Beringia 
      during Marine Isotope Stage 3. The evolutionary histories of these two taxa 
      underline the crucial biogeographical role of the Bering Land Bridge in the 
      distribution, turnover and maintenance of megafaunal populations in North 
      America.

AB  - The Vanuatu archipelago served as a gateway to Remote Oceania during one of the 
      most extensive human migrations to uninhabited lands ∼3,000 years ago. Ancient 
      DNA studies suggest an initial settlement by East Asian-related peoples that was 
      quickly followed by the arrival of Papuan-related populations, leading to a major 
      population turnover. Yet there is uncertainty over the population processes and 
      the sociocultural factors that have shaped the genomic diversity of ni-Vanuatu, 
      who present nowadays among the world's highest linguistic and cultural diversity. 
      Here, we report new genome-wide data for 1,433 contemporary ni-Vanuatu from 29 
      different islands, including 287 couples. We find that ni-Vanuatu derive their 
      East Asian- and Papuan-related ancestry from the same source populations and 
      descend from relatively synchronous, sex-biased admixture events that occurred 
      ∼1,700-2,300 years ago, indicating a peopling history common to the whole 
      archipelago. However, East Asian-related ancestry proportions differ markedly 
      across islands, suggesting that the Papuan-related population turnover was 
      geographically uneven. Furthermore, we detect Polynesian ancestry arriving 
      ∼600-1,000 years ago to Central and South Vanuatu in both Polynesian-speaking and 
      non-Polynesian-speaking populations. Last, we provide evidence for a tendency of 
      spouses to carry similar genetic ancestry, when accounting for relatedness 
      avoidance. The signal is not driven by strong genetic effects of specific loci or 
      trait-associated variants, suggesting that it results instead from social 
      assortative mating. Altogether, our findings provide an insight into both the 
      genetic history of ni-Vanuatu populations and how sociocultural processes have 
      shaped the diversity of their genomes.

AB  - Processes leading to range contractions and population declines of Arctic 
      megafauna during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene are uncertain, with 
      intense debate on the roles of human hunting, climatic change, and their synergy. 
      Obstacles to a resolution have included an overreliance on correlative rather 
      than process-explicit approaches for inferring drivers of distributional and 
      demographic change. Here, we disentangle the ecological mechanisms and threats 
      that were integral in the decline and extinction of the muskox (Ovibos moschatus) 
      in Eurasia and in its expansion in North America using process-explicit 
      macroecological models. The approach integrates modern and fossil occurrence 
      records, ancient DNA, spatiotemporal reconstructions of past climatic change, 
      species-specific population ecology, and the growth and spread of anatomically 
      modern humans. We show that accurately reconstructing inferences of past 
      demographic changes for muskox over the last 21,000 years require high dispersal 
      abilities, large maximum densities, and a small Allee effect. Analyses of 
      validated process-explicit projections indicate that climatic change was the 
      primary driver of muskox distribution shifts and demographic changes across its 
      previously extensive (circumpolar) range, with populations responding negatively 
      to rapid warming events. Regional analyses show that the range collapse and 
      extinction of the muskox in Europe (~13,000 years ago) was likely caused by 
      humans operating in synergy with climatic warming. In Canada and Greenland, 
      climatic change and human activities probably combined to drive recent population 
      sizes. The impact of past climatic change on the range and extinction dynamics of 
      muskox during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition signals a vulnerability of this 
      species to future increased warming. By better establishing the ecological 
      processes that shaped the distribution of the muskox through space and time, we 
      show that process-explicit macroecological models have important applications for 
      the future conservation and management of this iconic species in a warming 
      Arctic.

AB  - The realization that ancient biomolecules are preserved in "fossil" samples has 
      revolutionized archaeological science. Protein sequences survive longer than DNA, 
      but their phylogenetic resolution is inferior; therefore, careful assessment of 
      the research questions is required. Here, we show the potential of ancient 
      proteins preserved in Pleistocene eggshell in addressing a longstanding 
      controversy in human and animal evolution: the identity of the extinct bird that 
      laid large eggs which were exploited by Australia's indigenous people. The eggs 
      had been originally attributed to the iconic extinct flightless bird Genyornis 
      newtoni (†Dromornithidae, Galloanseres) and were subsequently dated to before 50 
      ± 5 ka by Miller et al. [Nat. Commun. 7, 10496 (2016)]. This was taken to 
      represent the likely extinction date for this endemic megafaunal species and thus 
      implied a role of humans in its demise. A contrasting hypothesis, according to 
      which the eggs were laid by a large mound-builder megapode (Megapodiidae, 
      Galliformes), would therefore acquit humans of their responsibility in the 
      extinction of Genyornis. Ancient protein sequences were reconstructed and used to 
      assess the evolutionary proximity of the undetermined eggshell to extant birds, 
      rejecting the megapode hypothesis. Authentic ancient DNA could not be confirmed 
      from these highly degraded samples, but morphometric data also support the 
      attribution of the eggshell to Genyornis. When used in triangulation to address 
      well-defined hypotheses, paleoproteomics is a powerful tool for reconstructing 
      the evolutionary history in ancient samples. In addition to the clarification of 
      phylogenetic placement, these data provide a more nuanced understanding of the 
      modes of interactions between humans and their environment.

AB  - In-depth knowledge about spatial and temporal variation in microbial diversity 
      and function is needed for a better understanding of ecological and evolutionary 
      responses to global change. In particular, the study of microbial ancient DNA 
      preserved in sediment archives from lakes and oceans can help us to evaluate the 
      responses of aquatic microbes in the past and make predictions about future 
      biodiversity change in those ecosystems. Recent advances in molecular genetic 
      methods applied to the analysis of historically deposited DNA in sediments have 
      not only allowed the taxonomic identification of past aquatic microbial 
      communities but also enabled tracing their evolution and adaptation to episodic 
      disturbances and gradual environmental change. Nevertheless, some challenges 
      remain for scientists to take full advantage of the rapidly developing field of 
      paleo-genetics, including the limited ability to detect rare taxa and reconstruct 
      complete genomes for evolutionary studies. Here, we provide a brief review of 
      some of the recent advances in the field of environmental paleomicrobiology and 
      discuss remaining challenges related to the application of molecular genetic 
      methods to study microbial diversity, ecology, and evolution in sediment 
      archives. We anticipate that, in the near future, environmental paleomicrobiology 
      will shed new light on the processes of microbial genome evolution and microbial 
      ecosystem responses to quaternary environmental changes at an unprecedented level 
      of detail. This information can, for example, aid geological reconstructions of 
      biogeochemical cycles and predict ecosystem responses to environmental 
      perturbations, including in the context of human-induced global changes.

TI  - Palaeoecological data indicates land-use changes across Europe linked to spatial 
      heterogeneity in mortality during the Black Death pandemic.
PG  - 297-306
LID - 10.1038/s41559-021-01652-4 [doi]
AB  - The Black Death (1347-1352 CE) is the most renowned pandemic in human history, 
      believed by many to have killed half of Europe's population. However, despite 
      advances in ancient DNA research that conclusively identified the pandemic's 
      causative agent (bacterium Yersinia pestis), our knowledge of the Black Death 
      remains limited, based primarily on qualitative remarks in medieval written 
      sources available for some areas of Western Europe. Here, we remedy this 
      situation by applying a pioneering new approach, 'big data palaeoecology', which, 
      starting from palynological data, evaluates the scale of the Black Death's 
      mortality on a regional scale across Europe. We collected pollen data on 
      landscape change from 261 radiocarbon-dated coring sites (lakes and wetlands) 
      located across 19 modern-day European countries. We used two independent methods 
      of analysis to evaluate whether the changes we see in the landscape at the time 
      of the Black Death agree with the hypothesis that a large portion of the 
      population, upwards of half, died within a few years in the 21 historical regions 
      we studied. While we can confirm that the Black Death had a devastating impact in 
      some regions, we found that it had negligible or no impact in others. These 
      inter-regional differences in the Black Death's mortality across Europe 
      demonstrate the significance of cultural, ecological, economic, societal and 
      climatic factors that mediated the dissemination and impact of the disease. The 
      complex interplay of these factors, along with the historical ecology of plague, 
      should be a focus of future research on historical pandemics.

AB  - Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are the most variable-sized mammalian 
      species on Earth, displaying a 40-fold size difference between breeds.(1) 
      Although dogs of variable size are found in the archeological record,(2-4) the 
      most dramatic shifts in body size are the result of selection over the last two 
      centuries, as dog breeders selected and propagated phenotypic extremes within 
      closed breeding populations.(5) Analyses of over 200 domestic breeds have 
      identified approximately 20 body size genes regulating insulin processing, fatty 
      acid metabolism, TGFβ signaling, and skeletal formation.(6-10) Of these, 
      insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) predominates, controlling approximately 15% 
      of body size variation between breeds.(8) The identification of a functional 
      mutation associated with IGF1 has thus far proven elusive.(6)(,)(10)(,)(11) Here, 
      to identify and elucidate the role of an ancestral IGF1 allele in the propagation 
      of modern canids, we analyzed 1,431 genome sequences from 13 species, including 
      both ancient and modern canids, thus allowing us to define the evolutionary 
      history of both ancestral and derived alleles at this locus. We identified a 
      single variant in an antisense long non-coding RNA (IGF1-AS) that interacts with 
      the IGF1 gene, creating a duplex. While the derived mutation predominates in both 
      modern gray wolves and large domestic breeds, the ancestral allele, which 
      predisposes to small size, was common in small-sized breeds and smaller wild 
      canids. Our analyses demonstrate that this major regulator of canid body size 
      nearly vanished in Pleistocene wolves, before its recent resurgence resulting 
      from human-imposed selection for small-sized breed dogs.

AB  - Massively parallel sequencing following hybridisation enrichment provides new 
      opportunities to obtain genetic data for various types of forensic testing and 
      has proven successful on modern as well as degraded and ancient DNA. A 
      customisable forensic intelligence panel that targeted 124 SNP markers (67 
      ancestry informative markers, 23 phenotype markers from the HIrisplex panel, and 
      35 Y-chromosome SNPs) was used to examine biogeographic ancestry, phenotype and 
      sex and Y-lineage in samples from different ethnic populations of Pakistan 
      including Pothwari, Gilgit, Baloach, Pathan, Kashmiri and Siraiki. Targeted 
      sequencing and computational data analysis pipeline allowed filtering of variants 
      across the targeted loci. Study samples showed an admixture between East Asian 
      and European ancestry. Eye colour was predicted accurately based on the highest 
      p-value giving overall prediction accuracy of 92.8%. Predictions were consistent 
      with reported hair colour for all samples, using the combined highest p-value 
      approach and step-wise model incorporating probability thresholds for light or 
      dark shade. Y-SNPs were successfully recovered only from male samples which 
      indicates the ability of this method to identify biological sex and allow 
      inference of Y-haplogroup. Our results demonstrate practicality of using 
      hybridisation enrichment and MPS to aid in human intelligence gathering and will 
      open many insights into forensic research in South Asia.

TI  - Investigating individual migration life histories: An isotopic case study from 
      17th to 18th century Nouvelle France.
PG  - 232-248
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.24455 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This isotopic study explores the mobility patterns of a growing urban 
      population from Notre Dame's Catholic cemetery (1691-1796), located in Montreal 
      (Canada). The site offers a unique opportunity to investigate early colonial 
      settlement in Nouvelle France through individual life patterns. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Stable oxygen isotopic compositions (δ(18)O) were measured on the enamel 
      of 32 individuals from the Notre Dame collection. Premolars and third molars were 
      selected, as they reflected the δ(18)O of the drinking water during childhood 
      (2.5-5.5 years) and pre-adulthood (9.5-15.5 years). Firstly, premolars from three 
      children (4-8 years of age) allowed us to provide a mean δ(18)O for the water 
      consumed locally (22.7 ±  1.0 ‰ vs. VSMOW). Then, our δ(18)O were compared with 
      published data from various geographical regions in North America (Eastern Canada 
      and the United States) and Europe (France and the British Isles) to highlight 
      mobility patterns of each individual. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent of our sample 
      (14 out of 29 individuals) did not reflect any long-distance mobility, as all 
      their δ(18)O reflected Montreal's variation during their lifetime. The remaining 
      (15 out of 29 individuals) experienced mobility within (n = 8) and outside 
      (n = 7) North America and at different phases of their life (five at 
      pre-adulthood, six at adulthood and four during both phases). Their migration 
      patterns were analyzed according to age, sex, diet and possible ancestry in order 
      to propose some "biographies." DISCUSSION: This study highlights high population 
      diversity in early colonial Montreal. Historians wrote that the city was growing, 
      not only with the arrival of Europeans (e.g., young male workers, sailors), but 
      also other groups (e.g., Indigenous people, slaves from North America). 
      Additional analyses (e.g., ancient DNA) will be needed to explore further this 
      phenomenon.

AB  - Old postcards with stamps might help unravelling historical family stories and 
      relationships. By employing ancient DNA recovered from world war I postage 
      stamps, we disprove a family saga of an illegitimate child born in 1887. We 
      developed a protocol to collect DNA from saliva, trapped and protected on the 
      backside of postage stamps glued on postcards. With replicate STR analyses we 
      were able to assemble almost full autosomal and Y-STR profiles of three male, 
      deceased family members. The illegitimate child turned out to be a legitimate 
      child of a later married couple.

TI  - Process-explicit models reveal pathway to extinction for woolly mammoth using 
      pattern-oriented validation.
PG  - 125-137
LID - 10.1111/ele.13911 [doi]
AB  - Pathways to extinction start long before the death of the last individual. 
      However, causes of early stage population declines and the susceptibility of 
      small residual populations to extirpation are typically studied in isolation. 
      Using validated process-explicit models, we disentangle the ecological mechanisms 
      and threats that were integral in the initial decline and later extinction of the 
      woolly mammoth. We show that reconciling ancient DNA data on woolly mammoth 
      population decline with fossil evidence of location and timing of extinction 
      requires process-explicit models with specific demographic and niche constraints, 
      and a constrained synergy of climatic change and human impacts. Validated models 
      needed humans to hasten climate-driven population declines by many millennia, and 
      to allow woolly mammoths to persist in mainland Arctic refugia until the 
      mid-Holocene. Our results show that the role of humans in the extinction dynamics 
      of woolly mammoth began well before the Holocene, exerting lasting effects on the 
      spatial pattern and timing of its range-wide extinction.

AB  - The recovery and analysis of genetic material obtained from thermally altered 
      human bones and teeth are increasingly important to forensic investigations, 
      especially in cases where soft-tissue identification is no longer possible. 
      Although little is known about how these fire-related processes affect DNA 
      degradation over time, next-generation sequencing technology in combination with 
      traditional osteobiographical applications may provide us clues to these 
      questions. In this study, we compare whole mitochondrial genome data generated 
      using two different DNA extraction methods from 27 thermally altered samples 
      obtained from fire victims (Maricopa County, Arizona) . DNA extracts were 
      converted to double-stranded DNA libraries and enriched for whole mitochondrial 
      DNA (mtDNA) using synthetic biotinylated RNA baits, then sequenced on an Illumina 
      MiSeq. We processed the mitochondrial data using an in-house computational 
      pipeline (MitoPipe1.0) composed of ancient DNA and modern genomics applications, 
      then compared the resulting information across the two extraction types and five 
      burn categories. Our analysis shows that DNA fragmentation increases with 
      temperature, but that the acute insult from fire combined with the lack of water 
      is insufficient to produce 5' and 3' terminal deamination characteristic of 
      ancient DNA. Our data also suggest an acute and significant point of DNA 
      degradation between 350 °C and 550 °C, and that the likelihood of generating high 
      quality mtDNA haplogroup calls decreases significantly at temperatures > 550 °C. 
      This research is part of a concerted effort to understand how fire affects our 
      ability to generate genetic profiles suitable for forensic identification 
      purposes.

LID - 10.1042/ETLS20210204 [doi]
AB  - Genetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has always been a useful tool for 
      forensic geneticists, mainly because of its ubiquitous presence in biological 
      material, even in the absence of nuclear DNA. Sequencing, however, is not a skill 
      that is part of the routine forensic analysis because of the relative rarity of 
      requests, and the need for retention of necessary skill sets and associated 
      accreditation issues. While standard Sanger sequencing may be relatively simple, 
      many requests are made in the face of compromised biological samples. Newer 
      technologies, provided through massively parallel sequencing (MPS), will increase 
      the opportunity for scientists to include this tool in their routine, 
      particularly for missing person investigations. MPS has also enabled a different 
      approach to sequencing that can increase sensitivity in a more targeted approach. 
      In these circumstances it is likely that only a laboratory that specialises in 
      undertaking forensic mtDNA analysis will be able to take these difficult cases 
      forward, more so because reviews of the literature have revealed significantly 
      high levels of typing errors in publications reporting mtDNA sequences. The 
      forensic community has set out important guidelines, not only in the practical 
      aspects of analysis, but also in the interpretation of that sequence to ensure 
      that accurate comparisons can be made. Analysis of low-level, compromised and 
      ancient DNA is not easy, however, as contamination is extremely difficult to 
      eliminate and circumstances leading to sequencing errors are all too easily 
      introduced. These problems, and solutions, are discussed in the article in

AB  - The Mongolian people, one of the Mongolic-speaking populations, are native to the 
      Mongolian Plateau in North China and southern Siberia. Many ancient DNA studies 
      recently reported extensive population transformations during the Paleolithic to 
      historic periods in this region, while little is known about the paternal genetic 
      legacy of modern geographically different Mongolians. Here, we genotyped 215 
      Y-chromosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (Y-SNPs) and 37 Y-chromosomal short 
      tandem repeats (Y-STRs) among 679 Mongolian individuals from Hohhot, Hulunbuir, 
      and Ordos in North China using the AGCU Y37 kit and our developed eight Y-SNP 
      SNaPshot panels (including two panels first reported herein). The C-M130 Y-SNP 
      SNaPshot panel defines 28 subhaplogroups, and the N/O/Q complementary Y-SNP 
      SNaPshot panel defines 30 subhaplogroups of N1b-F2930, N1a1a1a1a3-B197, Q-M242, 
      and O2a2b1a1a1a4a-CTS4658, which improved the resolution our developed Y-SNP 
      SNaPshot panel set and could be applied for dissecting the finer-scale paternal 
      lineages of Mongolic speakers. We found a strong association between 
      Mongolian-prevailing haplogroups and some observed microvariants among the newly 
      generated Y-STR haplotype data, suggesting the possibility of haplogroup 
      prediction based on the distribution of Y-STR haplotypes. We identified three 
      main ancestral sources of the observed Mongolian-dominant haplogroups, including 
      the local lineage of C2*-M217 and incoming lineages from other regions of 
      southern East Asia (O2*-M122, O1b*-P31, and N1*-CTS3750) and western Eurasia 
      (R1*-M173). We also observed DE-M145, D1*-M174, C1*-F3393, G*-M201, I-M170, 
      J*-M304, L-M20, O1a*-M119, and Q*-M242 at relatively low frequencies (< 5.00%), 
      suggesting a complex admixture history between Mongolians and other incoming 
      Eurasians from surrounding regions. Genetic clustering analyses indicated that 
      the studied Mongolians showed close genetic affinities with other Altaic-speaking 
      populations and Sinitic-speaking Hui people. The Y-SNP haplotype/haplogroup-based 
      genetic legacy not only revealed that the stratification among 
      geographically/linguistically/ethnically different Chinese populations was highly 
      consistent with the geographical division and language classification, but also 
      demonstrated that patrilineal genetic materials could provide fine-scale genetic 
      structures among geographically different Mongolian people, suggesting that our 
      developed high-resolution Y-SNP SNaPshot panels have the potential for forensic 
      pedigree searches and biogeographical ancestry inference.

TI  - Sedimentary ancient DNA shows terrestrial plant richness continuously increased 
      over the Holocene in northern Fennoscandia.

AB  - The effects of climate change on species richness are debated but can be informed 
      by the past. Here, we generated a sedimentary ancient DNA dataset covering 10 
      lakes and applied novel methods for data harmonization. We assessed the impact of 
      Holocene climate changes and nutrients on terrestrial plant richness in northern 
      Fennoscandia. We find that richness increased steeply during the rapidly warming 
      Early Holocene. In contrast to findings from most pollen studies, we show that 
      richness continued to increase thereafter, although the climate was stable, with 
      richness and the regional species pool only stabilizing during the past three 
      millennia. Furthermore, overall increases in richness were greater in catchments 
      with higher soil nutrient availability. We suggest that richness will increase 
      with ongoing warming, especially at localities with high nutrient availability 
      and assuming that human activity remains low in the region, although lags of 
      millennia may be expected.

AB  - Although protocols exist for the recovery of ancient DNA from land snail and 
      marine bivalve shells, marine conch shells have yet to be studied from a 
      paleogenomic perspective. We first present reference assemblies for both a 
      623.7 Mbp nuclear genome and a 15.4 kbp mitochondrial genome for Strombus 
      pugilis, the West Indian fighting conch. We next detail a method to extract and 
      sequence DNA from conch shells and apply it to conch from Bocas del Toro, Panama 
      across three time periods: recently-eaten and discarded (n = 3), Late Holocene 
      (984-1258 before present [BP]) archaeological midden (n = 5), and mid-Holocene 
      (5711-7187 BP) paleontological fossil coral reef (n = 5). These results are 
      compared to control DNA extracted from live-caught tissue and fresh shells 
      (n = 5). Using high-throughput sequencing, we were able to obtain S. pugilis 
      nuclear sequence reads from shells across all age periods: up to 92.5 thousand 
      filtered reads per sample in live-caught shell material, 4.57 thousand for modern 
      discarded shells, 12.1 thousand reads for archaeological shells, and 114 reads in 
      paleontological shells. We confirmed authenticity of the ancient DNA recovered 
      from the archaeological and paleontological shells based on 5.7× higher average 
      frequency of deamination-driven misincorporations and 15% shorter average read 
      lengths compared to the modern shells. Reads also mapped to the S. pugilis 
      mitochondrial genome for all but the paleontological shells, with consistent 
      ratios of mitochondrial to nuclear mapped reads across sample types. Our methods 
      can be applied to diverse archaeological sites to facilitate reconstructions of 
      the long-term impacts of human behaviour on mollusc evolutionary biology.

AB  - To evaluate the stability and resilience(1) of coastal ecosystem communities to 
      perturbations that occurred during the Anthropocene,(2) pre-industrial 
      biodiversity baselines inferred from paleoarchives are needed.(3)(,)(4) The study 
      of ancient DNA (aDNA) from sediments (sedaDNA)(5) has provided valuable 
      information about past dynamics of microbial species(6-8) and communities(9-18) 
      in relation to ecosystem variations. Shifts in planktonic protist communities 
      might significantly affect marine ecosystems through cascading effects,(19-21) 
      and therefore the analysis of this compartment is essential for the assessment of 
      ecosystem variations. Here, sediment cores collected from different sites of the 
      Bay of Brest (northeast Atlantic, France) allowed ca. 1,400 years of 
      retrospective analyses of the effects of human pollution on marine protists. 
      Comparison of sedaDNA extractions and metabarcoding analyses with different 
      barcode regions (V4 and V7 18S rDNA) revealed that protist assemblages in ancient 
      sediments are mainly composed of species known to produce resting stages. 
      Heavy-metal pollution traces in sediments were ascribed to the World War II 
      period and coincided with community shifts within dinoflagellates and 
      stramenopiles. After the war and especially from the 1980s to 1990s, protist 
      genera shifts followed chronic contaminations of agricultural origin. Community 
      composition reconstruction over time showed that there was no recovery to a 
      Middle Ages baseline composition. This demonstrates the irreversibility of the 
      observed shifts after the cumulative effect of war and agricultural pollutions. 
      Developing a paleoecological approach, this study highlights how human 
      contaminations irreversibly affect marine microbial compartments, which 
      contributes to the debate on coastal ecosystem preservation and restoration.

TI  - The transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture in Nubia: dental evidence 
      for and against selection, population continuity and discontinuity.
PG  - 20210969

AB  - Some researchers posit population continuity between Late Palaeolithic 
      hunter-gatherers of the late Pleistocene and Holocene agriculturalists from Lower 
      (northern) Nubia, in northeast Africa. Substantial craniodental differences in 
      these time-successive groups are suggested to result from in situ evolution. 
      Specifically, these populations are considered a model example for 
      subsistence-related selection worldwide in the transition to agriculture. Others 
      question continuity, with findings indicating that the largely homogeneous 
      Holocene populations differ significantly from late Pleistocene Lower Nubians. If 
      the latter are representative of the local populace, post-Pleistocene 
      discontinuity is implied. So who was ancestral to the Holocene agriculturalists? 
      Dental morphological analyses of 18 samples (1075 individuals), including one 
      dated to the 12th millennium BCE from Al Khiday, near the Upper Nubian border, 
      may provide an answer. It is the first Late Palaeolithic sample (n = 55) 
      recovered within the region in approximately 50 years. Using the Arizona State 
      University Dental Anthropology System to record traits and multivariate 
      statistics to estimate biological affinities, Al Khiday is comparable to several 
      Holocene samples, yet also highly divergent from contemporaneous Lower Nubians. 
      Thus, population continuity is indicated after all, but with late Pleistocene 
      Upper-rather than Lower Nubians as originally suggested-assuming dental traits 
      are adequate proxies for ancient DNA.

TI  - Approaches to osteoporosis in paleopathology: How did methodology shape bone loss 
      research?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper will review how different methods employed to study bone 
      loss in the past were used to explore different questions and aspects of bone 
      loss, how methodology has changed over time, and how these different approaches 
      have informed our understanding of bone loss in the past. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      A review and discussion is conducted on research protocols and results of 84 
      paleopathology publications on bone loss in archaeological skeletal collections 
      published between 1969 and 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The variety in research protocols 
      confounds accurate meta-analysis of previously published research; however, more 
      recent publications incorporate a combination of bone mass and bone quality based 
      methods. Biased sample selection has resulted in a predominance of European and 
      Medieval publications, limiting more general observations on bone loss in the 
      past. Collection of dietary or paleopathological covariables is underemployed in 
      the effort to interpret bone loss patterns. SIGNIFICANCE: Paleopathology 
      publications have demonstrated differences in bone loss between distinct 
      archaeological populations, between sex and age groups, and have suggested 
      factors underlying observed differences. However, a lack of a gold standard has 
      encouraged the use of a wide range of methods. Understanding how this array of 
      methods effects results is crucial in contextualizing our knowledge of bone loss 
      in the past. LIMITATIONS: The development of a research protocol is also 
      influenced by available expertise, available equipment, restrictions imposed by 
      the curator, and site-specific taphonomic aspects. These factors will likely 
      continue to cause (minor) biases even if a best practice can be established. 
      SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: Greater effort to develop uniform terminology 
      and operational definitions of osteoporosis in skeletal remains, as well as the 
      expansion of time scale and geographical areas studied. The Next-Generation 
      Sequencing revolution has also opened up the possibility of ancient DNA analyses 
      to study genetic predisposition to bone loss in the past.

AB  - Adaptation is typically studied by comparing modern populations with contrasting 
      environments. Individuals persisting in the ancestral habitat are typically used 
      to represent the ancestral founding population; however, it has been questioned 
      whether these individuals are good proxies for the actual ancestors.(1) To 
      address this, we applied a paleogenomics approach(2) to directly access the 
      ancestral genepool: partially sequencing the genomes of two 11- to 
      13,000-year-old stickleback recovered from the transitionary layer between marine 
      and freshwater sediments of two Norwegian isolation lakes(3) and comparing them 
      with 30 modern stickleback genomes from the same lakes and adjacent marine fjord, 
      in addition to a global dataset of 20 genomes.(4) The ancient stickleback shared 
      genome-wide ancestry with the modern fjord population, whereas modern lake 
      populations have lost substantial ancestral variation following founder effects, 
      and subsequent drift and selection. Freshwater-adaptive alleles found in one 
      ancient stickleback genome have not risen to high frequency in the present-day 
      population from the same lake. Comparison to the global dataset suggested 
      incomplete adaptation to freshwater in our modern lake populations. Our findings 
      reveal the impact of population bottlenecks in constraining adaptation due to 
      reduced efficacy of selection on standing variation present in founder 
      populations.

TI  - Sex estimation of teeth at different developmental stages using dimorphic enamel 
      peptide analysis.
PG  - 859-869
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.24231 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study tests, for the first time, the applicability of a new 
      method of sex estimation utilizing enamel peptides on a sample of deciduous and 
      permanent teeth at different stages of mineralization, from nonadults of unknown 
      sex, including perinates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 43 teeth from 29 
      nonadult individuals aged from 40 gestational weeks to 19 years old were 
      analyzed. The sample included pairs of fully mineralized and just developing 
      teeth from the same individual. The individuals were from four archaeological 
      sites in England: Piddington (1st-2nd centuries AD), Coach Lane, Victoria Gate, 
      and Fewston (all 18th-19th centuries). A method that identifies sex 
      chromosome-linked isoforms of the peptide amelogenin from human tooth enamel was 
      applied. The method utilizes a minimally destructive acid etching procedure and 
      subsequent nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: It was 
      possible to determine the sex of 28 of the nonadult individuals sampled (males = 
      20, females = 8, undetermined = 1). Only one sample failed (CL9), due to 
      insufficient mineralization of the sampled tooth enamel. Data are available via 
      ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD021683. DISCUSSION: Sufficient peptide 
      material to determine sex can be recovered even from the crowns of developing 
      perinatal teeth that are not fully mineralized. The minimally destructive and 
      inexpensive (compared to ancient DNA) nature of this procedure has significant 
      implications for bioarchaeological studies of infancy and childhood.

AB  - Worldwide decline in biodiversity during the Holocene has impeded a comprehensive 
      understanding of pre-human biodiversity and biogeography. This is especially true 
      on islands, because many recently extinct island taxa were morphologically 
      unique, complicating assessment of their evolutionary relationships using 
      morphology alone. The Caribbean remains an avian hotspot but was more diverse 
      before human arrival in the Holocene. Among the recently extinct lineages is the 
      enigmatic genus Nesotrochis, comprising three flightless species. Based on 
      morphology, Nesotrochis has been considered an aberrant rail (Rallidae) or 
      related to flufftails (Sarothruridae). We recovered a nearly complete 
      mitochondrial genome of Nesotrochis steganinos from fossils, discovering that it 
      is not a rallid but instead is sister to Sarothruridae, volant birds now 
      restricted to Africa and New Guinea, and the recently extinct, flightless 
      Aptornithidae of New Zealand. This result suggests a widespread or highly 
      dispersive most recent common ancestor of the group. Prior to human settlement, 
      the Caribbean avifauna had a far more cosmopolitan origin than is evident from 
      extant species.

TI  - The first probable evidence of leprosy in a male individual (17th-19th century 
      AD) unearthed in Northern Portugal (Travanca, Santa Maria da Feira).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study describes the first evidence of a probable 
      paleopathological case of leprosy from northern Portugal. MATERIALS: An adult 
      male, skeleton 403, exhumed from the Christian cemetery associated with the 
      church dedicated to Saint Mamede (Travanca, Santa Maria da Feira), dated from the 
      17th-19th century AD. METHODS: Standard bioarchaeological methods were used for 
      sex and age-at-death determinations, and leprosy-related bone lesions were 
      identified through macroscopic analysis guided by paleopathological diagnostic 
      criteria. RESULTS: The macroscopic observation revealed probable leprosy-related 
      skeletal lesions, namely tenuous rhinomaxillary changes, bilateral proliferative 
      periosteal reactions on the tibiae and fibulae, as well as concentric atrophy, 
      acro-osteolysis and ankyloses of foot bones. CONCLUSIONS: Skeleton 403 represents 
      a probable case of leprosy according to the nature and distribution pattern of 
      bony lesions observed. SIGNIFICANCE: This finding fills an important gap in the 
      history of leprosy in Portugal. Although historical sources show that the 
      majority of leprosaria were located in the northern part of the country, 
      suggesting that leprosy was more prevalent in this area of Portugal in the past, 
      no paleopathological evidence of this disease was reported for this region to 
      date. Furthermore, the inhumation of a leprosy sufferer in a 17th-19th century AD 
      Christian parish cemetery is deeply imbued with social meaning. SUGGESTION FOR 
      FUTURE RESEARCH: The future detailed study of the remaining skeletons unearthed 
      from the cemetery of the Church of São Mamede will hopefully reveal further 
      osteological evidence of leprosy in addition to the application of ancient DNA 
      analysis to confirm the presence of the pathogen of this disease. Also, further 
      documentary research is needed in order to expand appreciation of the 
      epidemiological and social impact of leprosy in the 17th-19th century AD 
      Portugal.

TI  - The composition of the founding population of Iceland: A new perspective from 3D

AB  - The settlement of Iceland in the Viking Age has been the focus of much research, 
      but the composition of the founding population remains the subject of debate. 
      Some lines of evidence suggest that almost all the founding population were 
      Scandinavian, while others indicate a mix of Scandinavians and people of Scottish 
      and Irish ancestry. To explore this issue further, we used three-dimensional 
      techniques to compare the basicrania of skeletons from archaeological sites in 
      Iceland, Scandinavia, and the British Isles. Our analyses yielded two main 
      results. One was that the founding population likely consisted of roughly equal 
      numbers of Scandinavians and people from the British Isles. The other was that 
      the immigrants who originated from the British Isles included individuals of 
      southern British ancestry as well as individuals of Scottish and Irish ancestry. 
      The first of these findings is consistent with the results of recent analyses of 
      modern and ancient DNA, while the second is novel. Our study, therefore, 
      strengthens the idea that the founding population was a mix of Scandinavians and 
      people from the British Isles, but also raises a new possibility regarding the 
      regions from which the settlers originated.

AB  - In the context of human evolution, the study of proteins may overcome the 
      limitation of the high degradation of ancient DNA over time to provide 
      biomolecular information useful for the phylogenetic reconstruction of hominid 
      taxa. In this study, we used a shotgun proteomics approach to compare the tooth 
      proteomes of extant human and non-human primates (gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutan 
      and baboon) in order to search for a panel of peptides able to discriminate 
      between taxa and further help reconstructing the evolutionary relationships of 
      fossil primates. Among the 25 proteins shared by the five genera datasets, we 
      found a combination of peptides with sequence variations allowing to 
      differentiate the hominid taxa in the proteins AHSG, AMBN, APOA1, BGN, C9, 
      COL11A2, COL22A1, COL3A1, DSPP, F2, LUM, OMD, PCOLCE and SERPINA1. The 
      phylogenetic tree confirms the placement of the samples in the appropriate genus 
      branches. Altogether, the results provide experimental evidence that a shotgun 
      proteomics approach on dental tissue has the potential to detect taxonomic 
      variation, which is promising for future investigations of uncharacterized and/or 
      fossil hominid/hominin specimens. SIGNIFICANCE: A shotgun proteomics approach on 
      human and non-human primate teeth allowed to identify peptides with taxonomic 
      interest, highlighting the potential for future studies on hominid fossils.

AB  - The ability to sequence DNA retrieved from ancient and historical material plays 
      a crucial role in reinforcing evolutionary and anthropological inference. While 
      the focus of the field is largely on analyzing DNA from ancient hominids and 
      other animals, we have also learned from plant ancient DNA (aDNA), in particular, 
      about human farming practices, crop domestication, environment management, 
      species invasion, and adaptation to various environmental conditions. In the 
      following protocols, we outline best practices for plant aDNA isolation, 
      preparation for sequencing, bioinformatic processing, and authentication. We 
      describe the process all the way from processing of archaeological or historical 
      plant material to characterizing and authenticating sequencing reads. In 
      alternative protocols, we include modifications to this process that are tailored 
      to strongly degraded DNA. Throughout, we stress the importance of precautionary

AB  - BACKGROUND: After over a decade of developments in field collection, laboratory 
      methods and advances in high-throughput sequencing, contamination remains a key 
      issue in ancient DNA research. Currently, human and microbial contaminant DNA 
      still impose challenges on cost-effective sequencing and accurate interpretation 
      of ancient DNA data. RESULTS: Here we investigate whether human contaminating DNA 
      can be found in ancient faunal sequencing datasets. We identify variable levels 
      of human contamination, which persists even after the sequence reads have been 
      mapped to the faunal reference genomes. This contamination has the potential to 
      affect a range of downstream analyses. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a fast and simple 
      method, based on competitive mapping, which allows identifying and removing human 
      contamination from ancient faunal DNA datasets with limited losses of true 
      ancient data. This method could represent an important tool for the ancient DNA 
      field.

AB  - The domestication of the horse some 5,500 years ago followed those of dogs, 
      sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs by ∼2,500-10,000 years. By providing fast 
      transportation and transforming warfare, the horse had an impact on human history 
      with no equivalent in the animal kingdom. Even though the equine sport industry 
      has considerable economic value today, the evolutionary history underlying the 
      emergence of the modern domestic horse remains contentious. In the last decade, 
      novel sequencing technologies have revolutionized our capacity to sequence the 
      complete genome of organisms, including from archaeological remains. Applied to 
      horses, these technologies have provided unprecedented levels of information and 
      have considerably changed models of horse domestication. This review illustrates 
      how ancient DNA, especially ancient genomes, has inspired researchers to rethink 
      the process by which horses were first domesticated and then diversified into a 
      variety of breeds showing a range of traits that are useful to humans.

TI  - Hydrogen isotopes in serial hair samples record season of death in a mummified 
      child from 19th century San Francisco, CA.
PG  - 606-614
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.24137 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mummified body of a small child was found in a sealed Barstow 
      cast iron casket during construction activity in San Francisco in 2016. Using 
      historical records and ancient DNA the child was determined to be Edith H. Cook. 
      She was born 28 November, 1873 in the city of San Francisco, and died of 
      "marasmus" on 13 October, 1876 also in San Francisco. AIMS: Currently, there are 
      few techniques for estimating human season of death in archaeological cases. 
      Hydrogen isotope ratios (δ2H) in hair keratin is known to strongly correlate with 
      drinking water. We explore δ2H in serial hair samples as a potential technique to 
      estimate season of death by comparing the δ2H record from hair to the known date 
      of death. MATERIALS & METHODS: Approximately 50 hairs were removed from the 
      scalp, aligned from the root, and cut into 5cm serial sections, each representing 
      approximately 2 weeks of growth, and the total sequence a total of 1 year of 
      growth. δ2H was measured on each 5cm segment and compared to previously-reported 
      δ13C, δ15N, and δ34S values. RESULTS: δ2H in the serial hair samples ranged 
      between -56‰ and -48‰, consistent with her water values recorded in surface 
      waters from San Francisco, and follow a sinusoidal pattern. Decreasing δ2H in 
      terminal samples before death suggest Fall as the season of death, consistent 
      with the known date of death. DISCUSSION: This test case shows that 
      archaeological hair preserves a seasonal signature in the form of changing 
      keratin δ2H values that correlate to changing δ2H in surface drinking water. 
      Terminal values in root record water ingested during the final week(s) before 
      death. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that this technique can be used to estimate season 
      of death in future archaeological or forensic cases where hair has been preserved 
      but date of death is unknown.

TI  - Development and comparative validation of genomic-driven PCR-based assays to 
      detect Xanthomonas citri pv. citri in citrus plants.
PG  - 296
LID - 10.1186/s12866-020-01972-8 [doi]
LID - 296
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asiatic Citrus Canker, caused by Xanthomonas citri pv. citri, 
      severely impacts citrus production worldwide and hampers international trade. 
      Considerable regulatory procedures have been implemented to prevent the 
      introduction and establishment of X. citri pv. citri into areas where it is not 
      present. The effectiveness of this surveillance largely relies on the 
      availability of specific and sensitive detection protocols. Although several PCR- 
      or real-time PCR-based methods are available, most of them showed analytical 
      specificity issues. Therefore, we developed new conventional and real-time 
      quantitative PCR assays, which target a region identified by comparative genomic 
      analyses, and compared them to existing protocols. RESULTS: Our assays target the 
      X. citri pv. citri XAC1051 gene that encodes for a putative transmembrane 
      protein. The real-time PCR assay includes an internal plant control (5.8S rDNA) 
      for validating the assay in the absence of target amplification. A 
      receiver-operating characteristic approach was used in order to determine a 
      reliable cycle cut-off for providing accurate qualitative results. Repeatability, 
      reproducibility and transferability between real-time devices were demonstrated 
      for this duplex qPCR assay (XAC1051-2qPCR). When challenged with an extensive 
      collection of target and non-target strains, both assays displayed a high 
      analytical sensitivity and specificity performance: LOD(95%) = 754 CFU ml(- 1) 
      (15 cells per reaction), 100% inclusivity, 97.2% exclusivity for XAC1051-2qPCR; 
      LOD(95%) = 5234 CFU ml(- 1) (105 cells per reaction), 100% exclusivity and 
      inclusivity for the conventional PCR. Both assays can detect the target from 
      naturally infected citrus fruit. Interestingly, XAC1051-2qPCR detected X. citri 
      pv. citri from herbarium citrus samples. The new PCR-based assays displayed 
      enhanced analytical sensitivity and specificity when compared with previously 
      published PCR and real-time qPCR assays. CONCLUSIONS: We developed new valuable 
      detection assays useful for routine diagnostics and surveillance of X. citri pv. 
      citri in citrus material. Their reliability was evidenced through numerous trials 
      on a wide range of bacterial strains and plant samples. Successful detection of 
      the pathogen was achieved from both artificially and naturally infected plants, 
      as well as from citrus herbarium samples, suggesting that these assays will have 
      positive impact both for future applied and academic research on this bacterium.

TI  - Estimation of Natural Selection and Allele Age from Time Series Allele Frequency 
      Data Using a Novel Likelihood-Based Approach.
PG  - 463-480
LID - 10.1534/genetics.120.303400 [doi]
AB  - Temporally spaced genetic data allow for more accurate inference of population 
      genetic parameters and hypothesis testing on the recent action of natural 
      selection. In this work, we develop a novel likelihood-based method for jointly 
      estimating selection coefficient and allele age from time series data of allele 
      frequencies. Our approach is based on a hidden Markov model where the underlying 
      process is a Wright-Fisher diffusion conditioned to survive until the time of the 
      most recent sample. This formulation circumvents the assumption required in 
      existing methods that the allele is created by mutation at a certain low 
      frequency. We calculate the likelihood by numerically solving the resulting 
      Kolmogorov backward equation backward in time while reweighting the solution with 
      the emission probabilities of the observation at each sampling time point. This 
      procedure reduces the two-dimensional numerical search for the maximum of the 
      likelihood surface, for both the selection coefficient and the allele age, to a 
      one-dimensional search over the selection coefficient only. We illustrate through 
      extensive simulations that our method can produce accurate estimates of the 
      selection coefficient and the allele age under both constant and nonconstant 
      demographic histories. We apply our approach to reanalyze ancient DNA data 
      associated with horse base coat colors. We find that ignoring demographic 
      histories or grouping raw samples can significantly bias the inference results.

AB  - Vaccination has transformed public health, most notably including the eradication 
      of smallpox. Despite its profound historical importance, little is known of the 
      origins and diversity of the viruses used in smallpox vaccination. Prior to the 
      twentieth century, the method, source and origin of smallpox vaccinations 
      remained unstandardised and opaque. We reconstruct and analyse viral vaccine 
      genomes associated with smallpox vaccination from historical artefacts. 
      Significantly, we recover viral molecules through non-destructive sampling of 
      historical materials lacking signs of biological residues. We use the 
      authenticated ancient genomes to reveal the evolutionary relationships of 
      smallpox vaccination viruses within the poxviruses as a whole.

TI  - The petrous bone: Ideal substrate in legal medicine?
PG  - 102305
LID - S1872-4973(20)30078-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.fsigen.2020.102305 [doi]
AB  - Over the last few years, palaeogenomic studies of the petrous bone (the densest 
      part of the temporal bone) have shown that it is a source of DNA in both larger 
      quantities and of better quality than other bones. This dense bone around the 
      otic capsule has therefore been called the choice substrate in palaeogenomics. 
      Because the practice of forensic genetics responds to different imperatives, we 
      implemented a study aimed at (i) understanding how and why the petrous bone is an 
      advantageous substrate in ancient DNA studies and (ii) establishing whether it is 
      advantageous in forensic STR typing. We selected 50 individual skeletal remains 
      and extracted DNA from one tooth and one petrous bone from each. We then 
      amplified 24 STR markers commonly used in forensic identification and compared 
      the quality of that amplification using the RFU intensities of the signal as read 
      on the STR profiles. We also performed histological analyses to compare (i) the 
      microscopic structure of a petrous bone and of a tooth and (ii) the microscopic 
      structure of fresh petrous bone and of an archaeological or forensic sample. We 
      show that the RFU intensities read on STR profiles are systematically higher in 
      experiments using DNA extracted from petrous bones rather than teeth. For this 
      reason, we were more likely to obtain a complete STR profile from petrous bone 
      material, increasing the chance of identification in a forensic setting. 
      Histological analyses revealed peculiar microstructural characteristics (tissue 
      organization), unique to the petrous bone, that might explain the good 
      preservation of DNA in that substrate. Therefore, it appears that despite the 
      necessity of analysing longer fragments in forensic STR typing compared to NGS 
      palaeogenomics, the use of petrous bones in forensic genetics could prove 
      valuable, especially in cases involving infants, toothless individuals or very 
      degraded skeletal remains.

AB  - The discovery of the 2,000-year-old Dead Sea Scrolls had an incomparable impact 
      on the historical understanding of Judaism and Christianity. "Piecing together" 
      scroll fragments is like solving jigsaw puzzles with an unknown number of missing 
      parts. We used the fact that most scrolls are made from animal skins to 
      "fingerprint" pieces based on DNA sequences. Genetic sorting of the scrolls 
      illuminates their textual relationship and historical significance. 
      Disambiguating the contested relationship between Jeremiah fragments supplies 
      evidence that some scrolls were brought to the Qumran caves from elsewhere; 
      significantly, they demonstrate that divergent versions of Jeremiah circulated in 
      parallel throughout Israel (ancient Judea). Similarly, patterns discovered in 
      non-biblical scrolls, particularly the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, suggest 
      that the Qumran scrolls represent the broader cultural milieu of the period. 
      Finally, genetic analysis divorces debated fragments from the Qumran scrolls. Our 
      study demonstrates that interdisciplinary approaches enrich the scholar's 
      toolkit.

AB  - With very little direct biological data of HIV-1 from before the 1980s, 
      far-reaching evolutionary and epidemiological inferences regarding the long 
      prediscovery phase of this pandemic are based on extrapolations by phylodynamic 
      models of HIV-1 genomic sequences gathered mostly over recent decades. Here, 
      using a very sensitive multiplex RT-PCR assay, we screened 1,645 formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded tissue specimens collected for pathology diagnostics in Central 
      Africa between 1958 and 1966. We report the near-complete viral genome in one 
      HIV-1 positive specimen from Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), from 
      1966 ("DRC66")-a nonrecombinant sister lineage to subtype C that constitutes the 
      oldest HIV-1 near full-length genome recovered to date. Root-to-tip plots showed 
      the DRC66 sequence is not an outlier as would be expected if dating estimates 
      from more recent genomes were systematically biased; and inclusion of the DRC66 
      sequence in tip-dated BEAST analyses did not significantly alter root and 
      internal node age estimates based on post-1978 HIV-1 sequences. There was larger 
      variation in divergence time estimates among datasets that were subsamples of the 
      available HIV-1 genomes from 1978 to 2014, showing the inherent phylogenetic 
      stochasticity across subsets of the real HIV-1 diversity. Our phylogenetic 
      analyses date the origin of the pandemic lineage of HIV-1 to a time period around 
      the turn of the 20th century (1881 to 1918). In conclusion, this unique archival 
      HIV-1 sequence provides direct genomic insight into HIV-1 in 1960s DRC, and, as 
      an ancient-DNA calibrator, it validates our understanding of HIV-1 evolutionary 
      history.

AB  - One of the most enduring surprises about the genetic history of Late Pleistocene 
      populations is that continuity is often disturbed by upheaval. In fact, studies 
      that support population continuity are increasingly rare in humans, a variety of 
      vertebrate taxa, and vascular plants (Hofreiter & Stewart 2009; Burbrink et al. 
      2016). Perhaps such continuity should not be expected as the Pleistocene is 
      marked by episodes of climate change, glaciation and the invasions of humans into 
      previously isolated areas. Although fossils are one of the primary sources for 
      inferring population continuity, a problem with fossil material is that, even if 
      similar morphological forms might exist in a place over time, they may not be 
      from the same genetic lineage. There are now readily available methods to assess 
      genetic continuity solely from DNA found in fossil material, provided the record 
      is fairly continuous. In a From the Cover article in this issue of Molecular 
      Ecology, Loog et al. (2020) apply some of these readily available methods to 
      analyse mitochondrial genomes and model the demography of wolves over the last 
      50,000 years.

AB  - Thermal degeneration of the DNA molecule presents a special challenge to 
      medico-legal investigations since low DNA yields, fragmented DNA molecules, and 
      damaged nucleotide bases hinder accurate STR genotyping. As a consequence, 
      fragments of severely burned human remains are often not amenable to standard DNA 
      recovery. However, current ancient DNA (aDNA) extraction methods have proven 
      highly effective at obtaining ultrashort DNA fragments (∼50 bp) from degraded 
      palaeontological and archaeological specimens. In this study, we compare DNA 
      yields and STR results obtained from two established aDNA and forensic DNA 
      extraction protocols by sampling multiple skeletal elements recovered from 
      victims (n = 23) involved in fire-related incidents. DNA yields and STR results 
      suggest an inverse correlation between DNA yield and STR quality and increasing 
      temperature. Despite the rapid thermal destruction of DNA at high temperatures, 
      we generated higher quality full and partial STR profiles using the aDNA 
      extraction protocol across all burn categories than the forensic total bone 
      demineralization extraction method. Our analysis suggests adopting aDNA 
      extraction methods as an alternative to current forensic practices to improve DNA 
      yields from challenging human remains.

TI  - Population genetic analysis of Shaanxi male Han Chinese population reveals 
      genetic differentiation and homogenization of East Asians.
PG  - e1209
LID - 10.1002/mgg3.1209 [doi]
LID - e1209
AB  - BACKGROUND: Shaanxi province, located in the upper Yellow River, has been 
      evidenced as the geographic origin of Chinese civilization, Sino-Tibetan-speaking 
      language, and foxtail or broomcorn millet farmers via the linguistic phylogenetic 
      spectrum, archeological documents, and genetic evidence. Nowadays, Han Chinese is 
      the dominant population in this area. The formation process of modern Shaanxi Han 
      population reconstructed via the ancient DNA is on the way, however, the patterns 
      of genetic relationships of modern Shaanxi Han, allele frequency distributions of 
      high mutated short tandem repeats (STRs) and corresponding forensic parameters 
      are remained to be explored. METHODS: Here, we successfully genotyped 23 
      autosomal STRs in 630 unrelated Shaanxi male Han individuals using the recently 
      updated Huaxia Platinum PCR amplification system. Forensic allele frequency and 
      parameters of all autosomal STRs were assessed. And comprehensive population 
      genetic structure was explored via various typical statistical technologies. 
      RESULTS: Population genetic analysis based on the raw-genotype dataset among 
      15,803 Eurasian individuals and frequency datasets among 56 populations generally 
      illustrated that linguistic stratification is significantly associated with the 
      genetic substructure of the East Asian population. Principal component analysis, 
      multidimensional scaling plots and phylogenetic tree further demonstrated that 
      Shaanxi Han has a close genetic relationship with geographically close Shanxi 
      Han, and showed that Han Chinese is a homogeneous population during the historic 
      and recent admixture from the STR variations. Except for Sinitic-speaking 
      populations, Shaanxi Han harbored more alleles sharing with 
      Tibeto-Burman-speaking populations than with other reference populations. Focused 
      on the allele frequency correlation and forensic parameters, all loci are in 
      accordance with the minimum requirements of HWE and LD. The observed combined 
      probability of discrimination of 8.2201E-28 and the cumulative power of exclusion 
      of 0.9999999995 in Shaanxi Han demonstrated that the studied STR loci are 
      informative and polymorphic, and this system can be used as a powerful routine 
      forensic tool in personal identification and parentage testing. CONCLUSION: Both 
      the geographical and linguistic divisions have shaped the genetic structure of 
      modern East Asian. And more forensic reference data should be obtained for 
      ethnically, culturally, geographically and linguistically different populations 
      for better routine forensic practice and population genetic studies.

AB  - The phylogenetic relationships between hominins of the Early Pleistocene epoch in 
      Eurasia, such as Homo antecessor, and hominins that appear later in the fossil 
      record during the Middle Pleistocene epoch, such as Homo sapiens, are highly 
      debated(1-5). For the oldest remains, the molecular study of these relationships 
      is hindered by the degradation of ancient DNA. However, recent research has 
      demonstrated that the analysis of ancient proteins can address this 
      challenge(6-8). Here we present the dental enamel proteomes of H. antecessor from 
      Atapuerca (Spain)(9,10) and Homo erectus from Dmanisi (Georgia)(1), two key 
      fossil assemblages that have a central role in models of Pleistocene hominin 
      morphology, dispersal and divergence. We provide evidence that H. antecessor is a 
      close sister lineage to subsequent Middle and Late Pleistocene hominins, 
      including modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans. This placement implies that 
      the modern-like face of H. antecessor-that is, similar to that of modern 
      humans-may have a considerably deep ancestry in the genus Homo, and that the 
      cranial morphology of Neanderthals represents a derived form. By recovering 
      AMELY-specific peptide sequences, we also conclude that the H. antecessor molar 
      fragment from Atapuerca that we analysed belonged to a male individual. Finally, 
      these H. antecessor and H. erectus fossils preserve evidence of enamel proteome 
      phosphorylation and proteolytic digestion that occurred in vivo during tooth 
      formation. Our results provide important insights into the evolutionary 
      relationships between H. antecessor and other hominin groups, and pave the way 
      for future studies using enamel proteomes to investigate hominin biology across 
      the existence of the genus Homo.

TI  - Plasmodium vivax Malaria Viewed through the Lens of an Eradicated European 
      Strain.
PG  - 773-785
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msz264 [doi]
AB  - The protozoan Plasmodium vivax is responsible for 42% of all cases of malaria 
      outside Africa. The parasite is currently largely restricted to tropical and 
      subtropical latitudes in Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Though, it was 
      historically present in most of Europe before being finally eradicated during the 
      second half of the 20th century. The lack of genomic information on the extinct 
      European lineage has prevented a clear understanding of historical population 
      structuring and past migrations of P. vivax. We used medical microscope slides 
      prepared in 1944 from malaria-affected patients from the Ebro Delta in Spain, one 
      of the last footholds of malaria in Europe, to generate a genome of a European 
      P. vivax strain. Population genetics and phylogenetic analyses placed this strain 
      basal to a cluster including samples from the Americas. This genome allowed us to 
      calibrate a genomic mutation rate for P. vivax, and to estimate the mean age of 
      the last common ancestor between European and American strains to the 15th 
      century. This date points to an introduction of the parasite during the European 
      colonization of the Americas. In addition, we found that some known variants for 
      resistance to antimalarial drugs, including Chloroquine and Sulfadoxine, were 
      already present in this European strain, predating their use. Our results shed 
      light on the evolution of an important human pathogen and illustrate the value of 
      antique medical collections as a resource for retrieving genomic information on 
      pathogens from the past.

TI  - Assessing changes in genomic divergence following a century of human-mediated 
      secondary contact among wild and captive-bred ducks.
PG  - 578-595
LID - 10.1111/mec.15343 [doi]
AB  - Along with manipulating habitat, the direct release of domesticated individuals 
      into the wild is a practice used worldwide to augment wildlife populations. We 
      test between possible outcomes of human-mediated secondary contact using genomic 
      techniques at both historical and contemporary timescales for two iconic duck 
      species. First, we sequence several thousand ddRAD-seq loci for contemporary 
      mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) throughout North America and two domestic mallard 
      types (i.e., known game-farm mallards and feral Khaki Campbell's). We show that 
      North American mallards may well be becoming a hybrid swarm due to interbreeding 
      with domesticated game-farm mallards released for hunting. Next, to attain a 
      historical perspective, we applied a bait-capture array targeting thousands of 
      loci in century-old (1842-1915) and contemporary (2009-2010) mallard and American 
      black duck (Anas rubripes) specimens. We conclude that American black ducks and 
      mallards have always been closely related, with a divergence time of 
      ~600,000 years before present, and likely evolved through prolonged isolation 
      followed by limited bouts of gene flow (i.e., secondary contact). They continue 
      to maintain genetic separation, a finding that overturns decades of prior 
      research and speculation suggesting the genetic extinction of the American black 
      duck due to contemporary interbreeding with mallards. Thus, despite having high 
      rates of hybridization, actual gene flow is limited between mallards and American 
      black ducks. Conversely, our historical and contemporary data confirm that the 
      intensive stocking of game-farm mallards during the last ~100 years has 
      fundamentally changed the genetic integrity of North America's wild mallard 
      population, especially in the east. It thus becomes of great interest to ask 
      whether the iconic North American mallard is declining in the wild due to 
      introgression of maladaptive traits from domesticated forms. Moreover, we 
      hypothesize that differential gene flow from domestic game-farm mallards into the 
      wild mallard population may explain the overall temporal increase in 
      differentiation between wild black ducks and mallards, as well as the uncoupling 
      of genetic diversity and effective population size estimates across time in our 
      results. Finally, our findings highlight how genomic methods can recover complex 
      population histories by capturing DNA preserved in traditional museum specimens.

TI  - Ancient DNA and high-resolution chronometry reveal a long-term human role in the

AB  - Quaternary paleontological and archaeological evidence often is crucial for 
      uncovering the historical mechanisms shaping modern diversity and distributions. 
      We take an interdisciplinary approach using multiple lines of evidence to 
      understand how past human activity has shaped long-term animal diversity in an 
      island system. Islands afford unique opportunities for such studies given their 
      robust fossil and archaeological records. Herein, we examine the only non-volant 
      terrestrial mammal endemic to the Bahamian Archipelago, the hutia Geocapromys 
      ingrahami. This capromyine rodent once inhabited many islands but is now 
      restricted to several small cays. Radiocarbon dated fossils indicate that hutias 
      were present on the Great Bahama Bank islands before humans arrived at AD 
      ~800-1000; all dates from other islands post-date human arrival. Using ancient 
      DNA from a subset of these fossils, along with modern representatives of Bahamian 
      hutia and related taxa, we develop a fossil-calibrated phylogeny. We found little 
      genetic divergence among individuals from within either the northern or southern 
      Bahamas but discovered a relatively deep North-South divergence (~750 ka). This 
      result, combined with radiocarbon dating and archaeological evidence, reveals a 
      pre-human biogeographic divergence, and an unexpected human role in shaping 
      Bahamian hutia diversity and biogeography across islands.

TI  - Inter-laboratory study on standardized MPS libraries: evaluation of performance,

AB  - We present results from an inter-laboratory massively parallel sequencing (MPS) 
      study in the framework of the SeqForSTRs project to evaluate forensically 
      relevant parameters, such as performance, concordance, and sensitivity, using a 
      standardized sequencing library including reference material, mixtures, and 
      ancient DNA samples. The standardized library was prepared using the ForenSeq DNA 
      Signature Prep Kit (primer mix A). The library was shared between eight European 
      laboratories located in Austria, France, Germany, The Netherlands, and Sweden to 
      perform MPS on their particular MiSeq FGx sequencers. Despite variation in 
      performance between sequencing runs, all laboratories obtained quality metrics 
      that fell within the manufacturer's recommended ranges. Furthermore, differences 
      in locus coverage did not inevitably adversely affect heterozygous balance. 
      Inter-laboratory concordance showed 100% concordant genotypes for the included 
      autosomal and Y-STRs, and still, X-STR concordance exceeded 83%. The exclusive 
      reasons for X-STR discordances were drop-outs at DXS10103. Sensitivity 
      experiments demonstrated that correct allele calling varied between sequencing 
      instruments in particular for lower DNA amounts (≤ 125 pg). The analysis of 
      compromised DNA samples showed the drop-out of one sample (FA10013B01A) while for 
      the remaining three degraded DNA samples MPS was able to successfully type ≥ 87% 
      of all aSTRs, ≥ 78% of all Y-STRs, ≥ 68% of all X-STRs, and ≥ 92% of all iSNPs 
      demonstrating that MPS is a promising tool for human identity testing, which in 
      return, has to undergo rigorous in-house validation before it can be implemented 
      into forensic routine casework.

TI  - A ligation-based single-stranded library preparation method to analyze cell-free 
      DNA and synthetic oligos.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), present in circulating blood plasma, contains 
      information about prenatal health, organ transplant reception, and cancer 
      presence and progression. Originally developed for the genomic analysis of highly 
      degraded ancient DNA, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) library preparation methods are 
      gaining popularity in the field of cfDNA analysis due to their efficiency and 
      ability to convert short, fragmented DNA into sequencing libraries without 
      altering DNA ends. However, current ssDNA methods are costly and time-consuming. 
      RESULTS: Here we present an efficient ligation-based single-stranded library 
      preparation method that is engineered to produce complex libraries in under 2.5 h 
      from as little as 1 nanogram of input DNA without alteration to the native ends 
      of template molecules. Our method, called Single Reaction Single-stranded LibrarY 
      or SRSLY, ligates uniquely designed Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) adapters in 
      a one-step combined phosphorylation/ligation reaction that foregoes 
      end-polishing. Using synthetic DNA oligos and cfDNA, we demonstrate the 
      efficiency and utility of this approach and compare with existing double-stranded 
      and single-stranded approaches for library generation. Finally, we demonstrate 
      that cfDNA NGS data generated from SRSLY can be used to analyze DNA fragmentation 
      patterns to deduce nucleosome positioning and transcription factor binding. 
      CONCLUSIONS: SRSLY is a versatile tool for converting short and fragmented DNA 
      molecules, like cfDNA fragments, into sequencing libraries while retaining native 
      lengths and ends.

AB  - This study describes the analysis of DNA from heat-killed (boilate) isolates of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis from two UK outbreaks where DNA was of sub-optimal 
      quality for the standard methodologies routinely used in microbial genomics. An 
      Illumina library construction method developed for sequencing ancient DNA was 
      successfully used to obtain whole genome sequences, allowing analysis of the 
      outbreak by gene-by-gene MLST, SNP mapping and phylogenetic analysis. All cases 
      were spoligotyped to the same Haarlem H1 sub-lineage. This is the first described 
      application of ancient DNA library construction protocols to allow whole genome 
      sequencing of a clinical tuberculosis outbreak. Using this method it is possible 
      to obtain epidemiologically meaningful data even when DNA is of insufficient 
      quality for standard methods.

TI  - Demographic reconstruction from ancient DNA supports rapid extinction of the 
      great auk.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.47509 [doi]
LID - e47509
AB  - The great auk was once abundant and distributed across the North Atlantic. It is 
      now extinct, having been heavily exploited for its eggs, meat, and feathers. We 
      investigated the impact of human hunting on its demise by integrating genetic 
      data, GPS-based ocean current data, and analyses of population viability. We 
      sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes of 41 individuals from across the 
      species' geographic range and reconstructed population structure and population 
      dynamics throughout the Holocene. Taken together, our data do not provide any 
      evidence that great auks were at risk of extinction prior to the onset of 
      intensive human hunting in the early 16(th) century. In addition, our population 
      viability analyses reveal that even if the great auk had not been under threat by 
      environmental change, human hunting alone could have been sufficient to cause its 
      extinction. Our results emphasise the vulnerability of even abundant and 
      widespread species to intense and localised exploitation.

TI  - Early Pleistocene enamel proteome from Dmanisi resolves Stephanorhinus phylogeny.
PG  - 103-107
LID - 10.1038/s41586-019-1555-y [doi]
AB  - The sequencing of ancient DNA has enabled the reconstruction of speciation, 
      migration and admixture events for extinct taxa(1). However, the irreversible 
      post-mortem degradation(2) of ancient DNA has so far limited its recovery-outside 
      permafrost areas-to specimens that are not older than approximately 0.5 million 
      years (Myr)(3). By contrast, tandem mass spectrometry has enabled the sequencing 
      of approximately 1.5-Myr-old collagen type I(4), and suggested the presence of 
      protein residues in fossils of the Cretaceous period(5)-although with limited 
      phylogenetic use(6). In the absence of molecular evidence, the speciation of 
      several extinct species of the Early and Middle Pleistocene epoch remains 
      contentious. Here we address the phylogenetic relationships of the Eurasian 
      Rhinocerotidae of the Pleistocene epoch(7-9), using the proteome of dental enamel 
      from a Stephanorhinus tooth that is approximately 1.77-Myr old, recovered from 
      the archaeological site of Dmanisi (South Caucasus, Georgia)(10). Molecular 
      phylogenetic analyses place this Stephanorhinus as a sister group to the clade 
      formed by the woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) and Merck's rhinoceros 
      (Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis). We show that Coelodonta evolved from an early 
      Stephanorhinus lineage, and that this latter genus includes at least two distinct 
      evolutionary lines. The genus Stephanorhinus is therefore currently paraphyletic, 
      and its systematic revision is needed. We demonstrate that sequencing the 
      proteome of Early Pleistocene dental enamel overcomes the limitations of 
      phylogenetic inference based on ancient collagen or DNA. Our approach also 
      provides additional information about the sex and taxonomic assignment of other 
      specimens from Dmanisi. Our findings reveal that proteomic investigation of 
      ancient dental enamel-which is the hardest tissue in vertebrates(11), and is 
      highly abundant in the fossil record-can push the reconstruction of molecular 
      evolution further back into the Early Pleistocene epoch, beyond the currently 
      known limits of ancient DNA preservation.

TI  - Hominin and animal activities in the microstratigraphic record from Denisova Cave

AB  - Denisova Cave in southern Siberia uniquely contains evidence of occupation by a 
      recently discovered group of archaic hominins, the Denisovans, starting from the 
      middle of the Middle Pleistocene. Artefacts, ancient DNA and a range of animal 
      and plant remains have been recovered from the sedimentary deposits, along with a 
      few fragmentary fossils of Denisovans, Neanderthals and a first-generation 
      Neanderthal-Denisovan offspring. The deposits also contain microscopic traces of 
      hominin and animal activities that can provide insights into the use of the cave 
      over the last 300,000 years. Here we report the results of a micromorphological 
      study of intact sediment blocks collected from the Pleistocene deposits in the 
      Main and East Chambers of Denisova Cave. The presence of charcoal attests to the 
      use of fire by hominins, but other evidence of their activities preserved in the 
      microstratigraphic record are few. The ubiquitous occurrence of coprolites, which 
      we attribute primarily to hyenas, indicates that the site was visited for much of 
      its depositional history by cave-dwelling carnivores. Microscopic traces of 
      post-depositional diagenesis, bioturbation and incipient cryoturbation are 
      observed in only a few regions of the deposit examined here. Micromorphology can 
      help identify areas of sedimentary deposit that are most conducive to ancient DNA 
      preservation and could be usefully integrated with DNA analyses of sediments at 
      archaeological sites to illuminate features of their human and environmental 
      history that are invisible to the naked eye.

AB  - Genome architecture is well diversified among eukaryotes in terms of size and 
      content, with many being radically shaped by ancient and ongoing genome conflicts 
      with transposable elements (e.g., the large transposon-rich genomes common among 
      plants). In ciliates, a group of microbial eukaryotes with distinct somatic and 
      germ-line genomes present in a single cell, the consequences of these genome 
      conflicts are most apparent in their developmentally programmed genome 
      rearrangements. This complicated developmental phenomenon has largely 
      overshadowed and outpaced our understanding of how germ-line and somatic genome 
      architectures have influenced the evolutionary dynamism and potential in these 
      taxa. In our review, we highlight three central concepts: how the evolution of 
      atypical ciliate germ-line genome architectures is linked to ancient genome 
      conflicts; how the complex, epigenetically guided transformation of germline to 
      soma during development can generate widespread genetic variation; and how these 
      features, coupled with their unusual life cycle, have increased the rate of 
      molecular evolution linked to genome architecture in these taxa.

TI  - Contrasting Paternal and Maternal Genetic Histories of Thai and Lao Populations.
PG  - 1490-1506
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msz083 [doi]
AB  - The human demographic history of Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) has not been well 
      studied; in particular, there have been very few sequence-based studies of 
      variation in the male-specific portions of the Y chromosome (MSY). Here, we 
      report new MSY sequences of ∼2.3 mB from 914 males and combine these with 
      previous data for a total of 928 MSY sequences belonging to 59 populations from 
      Thailand and Laos who speak languages belonging to three major Mainland Southeast 
      Asia families: Austroasiatic, Tai-Kadai, and Sino-Tibetan. Among the 92 MSY 
      haplogroups, two main MSY lineages (O1b1a1a* [O-M95*] and O2a* [O-M324*]) 
      contribute substantially to the paternal genetic makeup of Thailand and Laos. We 
      also analyze complete mitochondrial DNA genome sequences published previously 
      from the same groups and find contrasting pattern of male and female genetic 
      variation and demographic expansions, especially for the hill tribes, Mon, and 
      some major Thai groups. In particular, we detect an effect of postmarital 
      residence pattern on genetic diversity in patrilocal versus matrilocal groups. 
      Additionally, both male and female demographic expansions were observed during 
      the early Mesolithic (∼10 ka), with two later major male-specific expansions 
      during the Neolithic period (∼4-5 ka) and the Bronze/Iron Age (∼2.0-2.5 ka). 
      These two later expansions are characteristic of the modern Austroasiatic and 
      Tai-Kadai groups, respectively, consistent with recent ancient DNA studies. We 
      simulate MSY data based on three demographic models (continuous migration, demic 
      diffusion, and cultural diffusion) of major Thai groups and find different 
      results from mitochondrial DNA simulations, supporting contrasting male and 
      female genetic histories.

LID - 10.1111/1556-4029.13973 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we sought to document the efficiency of primer extension capture 
      (PEC) as a method to enrich DNA eluates of targeted DNA molecules and remove 
      nontarget molecules from pools containing both. Efficiency of the method was 
      estimated by comparing number of "copies in" to "copies out" by quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction. PEC retention of DNA targets ranging 109-288 base 
      pairs (bps) in length was 15.88-2.14% (i.e., loss of 84.12-97.86% of target 
      molecules). Experimental modifications of the PEC method resulted in no 
      significant improvements. However, the benefit of PEC was revealed in its ability 
      to remove most nontarget DNA molecules (99.99%). We also discovered that many 
      (56.69%) of the target molecules are "lost" prior to their immobilization on the 
      streptavidin-coated beads. These estimates of methodological efficiency are 
      directly comparable to previous ones observed following "fishing" for DNA, an 
      alternative method for DNA enrichment.

TI  - A global perspective for biodiversity history with ancient environmental DNA.
PG  - 2456-2458
LID - 10.1111/mec.15118 [doi]
AB  - The past centuries have seen tremendous turnovers in species distributions and 
      biodiversity due to anthropogenic impacts on a global scale. The processes are 
      ongoing and mostly not well documented. Long-term records of biotic change can be 
      recovered from sedimentary deposits, but traditional analyses were restricted to 
      organisms that leave behind visible traces and molecular genetic tools were 
      mostly employed on samples that promised good DNA preservation. In this issue of 
      Molecular Ecology, Shaw, Weyrich, Hallegraeff and Cooper (2019) and Gomez Cabrera 
      et al. (2019) present two studies on marine sedimentary records from warm 
      environments, in which they successfully analyze ancient environmental DNA 
      (aeDNA) on a decadal and centennial scale. Notably, the studies were conducted on 
      novel samples with nonoptimal preservation conditions for ancient DNA - 
      historical collections of ship ballast tank sediments from Australia and two 
      coral reef cores spanning up to 750 years (Figure 1) - but yielded a high 
      diversity of taxa. This highlights that aeDNA is a promising tool to globally 
      study biodiversity history on scales of decades to centuries - the timeframe most 
      relevant to human society in the context of both current climate change and 
      direct anthropogenic modifications of the environment.

AB  - Proving voyaging at sea by Palaeolithic humans is a difficult archaeological 
      task, even for short distances. In the Mediterranean, a commonly accepted sea 
      crossing is that from the Italian Peninsula to Sicily by anatomically modern 
      humans, purportedly of the Aurignacian culture. This claim, however, was only 
      supported by the typological attribution to the Aurignacian of the lithic 
      industries from the insular site of Fontana Nuova. AMS radiocarbon dating 
      undertaken as part of our research shows that the faunal remains, previously 
      considered Aurignacian, actually date to the Holocene. Absolute dating on 
      dentinal collagen also attributes the human teeth from the site to the early 
      Holocene, although we were unable to obtain ancient DNA to evaluate their 
      ancestry. Ten radiocarbon dates on human and other taxa are comprised between 
      9910-9700 cal. BP and 8600-8480 cal. BP, indicating that Fontana Nuova was 
      occupied by Mesolithic and not Aurignacian hunter-gatherers. Only a new study of 
      the lithic assemblage could establish if the material from Fontana Nuova is a 
      mixed collection that includes both late Upper Palaeolithic (Epigravettian) and 
      Mesolithic artefacts, as can be suggested by taking into account both the results 
      of our study and of the most recent reinterpretation of the lithics. 
      Nevertheless, this research suggests that the notion that Aurignacian groups were 
      present in Sicily should now be revised. Another outcome of our study is that we 
      found that three specimens, attributed on grounds both of morphological and ZooMS 
      identifications to Cervus elaphus, had δ13C values significantly higher than any 
      available for such species in Europe.

TI  - The relative roles of maternal survival and inter-personal violence as selection 
      pressures on the persistence of Neanderthal hypercoagulability alleles in modern 
      Europeans.
PG  - 99-108
LID - 10.1080/03014460.2019.1622038 [doi]
AB  - Background: Simonti et al. reported variation in the frequency of Neanderthal 
      alleles found in modern humans and argued that they may have provided an 
      evolutionary advantage. One such allele is SNP rs3917862, associated with 
      hypercoagulability. rs3917862 can be deleterious, but can also help prevent blood 
      loss. Aim: To investigate two possible selective pressure hypotheses for 
      rs3917862 surviving to higher frequencies: deaths from interpersonal violent 
      trauma and childbirth. Subjects and methods: Mortality data from modern 
      hunter-gatherers models the living conditions and causes of death of humans and 
      Neanderthals at the point of admixture. Results: National census data indicates a 
      positive correlation between the presence of rs3917862 and decreased maternal 
      mortality ratios. When the maternal mortality ratio is modelled using GDP, births 
      attended by skilled assistants and the presence of rs3917862, women are 0.1% more 
      likely to die in childbirth in populations lacking rs3917862. Deaths due to 
      violence show no correlation with rs3917862. Conclusion: These findings challenge 
      the idea that Neanderthal admixture has negatively impacted the overall health of 
      modern humans. Maternal survival may have acted as a selective pressure for the 
      persistence of hypercoagulability alleles in modern Europeans. Understanding the 
      role of hypercoagulability in childbirth, and the role of rs3917862, could help 
      to reduce maternal mortality ratios.

AB  - This case study reports the anthropological analysis of bones remains discovered 
      on Riou Island (Marseille, France) and the story of two World War II fighter 
      pilots. The discovery of bones on "The Fountain of the Greeks" square on Riou 
      Island occurred in the 1960's and a first anthropological study described a 
      35-year-old man, about 1.77 m tall, buried since an estimated period between the 
      13th and 16th centuries. The case was "closed" and the bones were considered as 
      isolated archaeological remains. Few years later, near the coasts of Riou Island, 
      parts of two planes were discovered. One was from of a German Messerschmitt Bf 
      109 F-4 of the Luftwaffe piloted by Prince Alexis fürst zu Bentheim und 
      Steinfurt, and the other from a French P-38 Lightning F-5 B piloted by Antoine de 
      Saint-Exupery. Therefore, the identification of the skeletal remains mentioned 
      above was then thought to be perhaps one of the two World War II pilots. In this 
      particular context we performed forensic and molecular biology analyses to 
      resolve this identification.

AB  - Human impacts have substantially reduced avian biodiversity in many parts of the 
      world, particularly on isolated islands of the Pacific Ocean. The New Zealand 
      archipelago, including its five subantarctic island groups, holds breeding 
      grounds for a third of the world's penguin species, including several 
      representatives of the diverse crested penguin genus Eudyptes. While this 
      species-rich genus has been little studied genetically, recent population 
      estimates indicate that several Eudyptes taxa are experiencing demographic 
      declines. Although crested penguins are currently limited to southern regions of 
      the New Zealand archipelago, prehistoric fossil and archaeological deposits 
      suggest a wider distribution during prehistoric times, with breeding ranges 
      perhaps extending to the North Island. Here, we analyse ancient, historic and 
      modern DNA sequences to explore two hypotheses regarding the recent history of 
      Eudyptes in New Zealand, testing for (1) human-driven extinction of Eudyptes 
      lineages; and (2) reduced genetic diversity in surviving lineages. From 83 
      prehistoric bone samples, each tentatively identified as 'Eudyptes spp.', we 
      genetically identified six prehistoric penguin taxa from mainland New Zealand, 
      including one previously undescribed genetic lineage. Moreover, our Bayesian 
      coalescent analyses indicated that, while the range of Fiordland crested penguin 
      (E. pachyrhynchus) may have contracted markedly over the last millennium, genetic 
      DNA diversity within this lineage has remained relatively constant. This result 
      contrasts with human-driven biodiversity reductions previously detected in 
      several New Zealand coastal vertebrate taxa.

AB  - All organisms release their DNA into the environment through processes such as 
      excretion and the senescence of tissues and limbs. This DNA, often referred to as 
      environmental DNA (eDNA) or sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA), can be recovered 
      from both present-day and ancient soils, fecal samples, bodies of water and lake 
      cores, and even air. While eDNA is a potentially useful record of past and 
      present biodiversity, several challenges complicate data generation and 
      interpretation of results. Most importantly, eDNA samples tend to be highly 
      taxonomically mixed, and the target organism or group of organisms may be present 
      at very low abundance within this mixture. To overcome this challenge, enrichment 
      approaches are often used to target specific taxa of interest. Here, we describe 
      a protocol to amplify metabarcodes or short, variable loci that identify lineages 
      within broad taxonomic groups (e.g., plants, mammals), using the polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) with established generic "barcode" primers. We also provide a 
      catalog of animal and plant barcode primers that, because they target relatively 
      short fragments of DNA, are potentially suitable for use with degraded DNA.

TI  - The influences of genes, the environment, and social factors on the evolution of 
      skin color diversity in India.
PG  - e23170
LID - 10.1002/ajhb.23170 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Skin color is a highly visible and variable trait across human 
      populations. It is not yet clear how evolutionary forces interact to generate 
      phenotypic diversity. Here, we sought to unravel through an integrative framework 
      the role played by three factors-demography and migration, sexual selection, and 
      natural selection-in driving skin color diversity in India. METHODS: Skin 
      reflectance data were collected from 10 diverse socio-cultural populations along 
      the latitudinal expanse of India, including both sexes. We first looked at how 
      skin color varies within and between these populations. Second, we compared 
      patterns of sexual dimorphism in skin color. Third, we studied the influence of 
      ultraviolet radiation on skin color throughout India. Finally, we attempted to 
      disentangle the interactions between these factors in the context of available 
      genetic data. RESULTS: We found that the relative importance of these forces 
      varied between populations. Social factors and population structure have played a 
      stronger role than natural selection in shaping skin color diversity across 
      India. Phenotypic overprinting resulted from additional genetic mutations 
      overriding the skin lightening effect of variants such as the SLC24A5 rs1426654-A 
      allele in some populations, in the context of the variable influence of sexual 
      selection. Furthermore, specific genotypes are not associated reliably with 
      specific skin color phenotypes. This result has relevance for DNA forensics and 
      ancient DNA research. CONCLUSIONS: India is a crucible of macro- and 
      micro-evolutionary forces, and the complex interactions of physical and social 
      forces are visible in the patterns of skin color seen today in the country.

TI  - Carriers of mitochondrial DNA macrohaplogroup L3 basal lineages migrated back to 
      Africa from Asia around 70,000 years ago.
PG  - 98

AB  - BACKGROUND: The main unequivocal conclusion after three decades of 
      phylogeographic mtDNA studies is the African origin of all extant modern humans. 
      In addition, a southern coastal route has been argued for to explain the Eurasian 
      colonization of these African pioneers. Based on the age of macrohaplogroup L3, 
      from which all maternal Eurasian and the majority of African lineages originated, 
      the out-of-Africa event has been dated around 60-70 kya. On the opposite side, we 
      have proposed a northern route through Central Asia across the Levant for that 
      expansion and, consistent with the fossil record, we have dated it around 125 
      kya. To help bridge differences between the molecular and fossil record ages, in 
      this article we assess the possibility that mtDNA macrohaplogroup L3 matured in 
      Eurasia and returned to Africa as basal L3 lineages around 70 kya. RESULTS: The 
      coalescence ages of all Eurasian (M,N) and African (L3 ) lineages, both around 71 
      kya, are not significantly different. The oldest M and N Eurasian clades are 
      found in southeastern Asia instead near of Africa as expected by the southern 
      route hypothesis. The split of the Y-chromosome composite DE haplogroup is very 
      similar to the age of mtDNA L3. An Eurasian origin and back migration to Africa 
      has been proposed for the African Y-chromosome haplogroup E. Inside Africa, 
      frequency distributions of maternal L3 and paternal E lineages are positively 
      correlated. This correlation is not fully explained by geographic or ethnic 
      affinities. This correlation rather seems to be the result of a joint and global 
      replacement of the old autochthonous male and female African lineages by the new 
      Eurasian incomers. CONCLUSIONS: These results are congruent with a model 
      proposing an out-of-Africa migration into Asia, following a northern route, of 
      early anatomically modern humans carrying pre-L3 mtDNA lineages around 125 kya, 
      subsequent diversification of pre-L3 into the basal lineages of L3, a return to 
      Africa of Eurasian fully modern humans around 70 kya carrying the basal L3 
      lineages and the subsequent diversification of Eurasian-remaining L3 lineages 
      into the M and N lineages in the outside-of-Africa context, and a second Eurasian 
      global expansion by 60 kya, most probably, out of southeast Asia. Climatic 
      conditions and the presence of Neanderthals and other hominins might have played 
      significant roles in these human movements. Moreover, recent studies based on 
      ancient DNA and whole-genome sequencing are also compatible with this hypothesis.

AB  - Ancient neoplasms diagnosed in the soft tissues of mummies are limited to 18 
      cases so far, with only 5 malignant tumors. The apparent paucity of neoplasms in 
      ancient populations is sometimes attributed to shorter life spans and fewer 
      oncogenic substances in the environment. However, this paucity may also be a 
      result of the scarcity of autopsies of mummies, together with technical 
      difficulties in detecting neoplastic lesions in mummified tissues. An exception, 
      and example of the benefits of thorough systematic analysis, is the small sample 
      of 10 Renaissance mummies from Naples (15th-16th centuries), in which 3 cases of 
      cancer were found. In order to increase detection of soft tissue tumors, it is 
      imperative that mummies undergo systematic autopsies and histological 
      examinations performed by skilled paleopathologists. This review of the known 
      ancient soft tissue neoplasms demonstrates the state of histology of malignant 
      and benign soft tissue neoplasms in mummies, and the potential for further study. 
      The limitations of paleopathological diagnosis will be discussed and an argument 
      will be made for the use of autopsies and histological analysis on mummified 
      human remains.

TI  - Cranial measures and ancient DNA both show greater similarity of Neandertals to 
      recent modern Eurasians than to recent modern sub-Saharan Africans.
PG  - 170-178
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.23413 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ancient DNA analysis has shown that present-day humans of Eurasian 
      ancestry are more similar to Neandertals than are present-day humans of 
      sub-Saharan African ancestry, reflecting interbreeding after modern humans first 
      left Africa. We use craniometric data to test the hypothesis that the crania of 
      recent modern humans show the same pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We computed 
      Mahalanobis squared distances between a published Neandertal centroid based on 37 
      craniometric traits and each of 2,413 recent modern humans from the Howells 
      global data set (N = 373 sub-Saharan Africans, N = 2,040 individuals of Eurasian 
      descent). RESULTS: The average distance to the Neandertal centroid is 
      significantly lower for Eurasian crania than for sub-Saharan African crania as 
      expected from the findings of ancient DNA (p < 0.001). This result holds when 
      examining distances for separate geographic regions of humans of Eurasian descent 
      (Europeans, Asians, Australasians, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders). Most 
      of these results are also seen when examining distances partitioning size and 
      shape variation. DISCUSSION: Our results show that the genetic difference in 
      Neandertal ancestry seen in the DNA of present-day sub-Saharan Africans and 
      Eurasians is also found in patterns of recent modern human craniometric 
      variation.

TI  - Human bony labyrinth is an indicator of population history and dispersal from 
      Africa.
PG  - 4128-4133
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1717873115 [doi]
AB  - The dispersal of modern humans from Africa is now well documented with genetic 
      data that track population history, as well as gene flow between populations. 
      Phenetic skeletal data, such as cranial and pelvic morphologies, also exhibit a 
      dispersal-from-Africa signal, which, however, tends to be blurred by the effects 
      of local adaptation and in vivo phenotypic plasticity, and that is often 
      deteriorated by postmortem damage to skeletal remains. These complexities raise 
      the question of which skeletal structures most effectively track neutral 
      population history. The cavity system of the inner ear (the so-called bony 
      labyrinth) is a good candidate structure for such analyses. It is already fully 
      formed by birth, which minimizes postnatal phenotypic plasticity, and it is 
      generally well preserved in archaeological samples. Here we use morphometric data 
      of the bony labyrinth to show that it is a surprisingly good marker of the global 
      dispersal of modern humans from Africa. Labyrinthine morphology tracks genetic 
      distances and geography in accordance with an isolation-by-distance model with 
      dispersal from Africa. Our data further indicate that the neutral-like pattern of 
      variation is compatible with stabilizing selection on labyrinth morphology. Given 
      the increasingly important role of the petrous bone for ancient DNA recovery from 
      archaeological specimens, we encourage researchers to acquire 3D morphological 
      data of the inner ear structures before any invasive sampling. Such data will 
      constitute an important archive of phenotypic variation in present and past 
      populations, and will permit individual-based genotype-phenotype comparisons.

TI  - Ancient DNA analysis of Indigenous rockfish use on the Pacific Coast: 
      Implications for marine conservation areas and fisheries management.
PG  - e0192716

AB  - Rockfish (Sebastes spp.) are a common marine fish in nearshore and continental 
      shelf environments in the North Pacific Ocean. They are frequently identified in 
      coastal archaeological sites in western North America; however, the morphological 
      similarity of rockfish species limits conventional zooarchaeological 
      identifications to the genus level. This study applies ancient DNA analysis to 96 
      archaeological rockfish specimens from four sites on separate islands in an 
      archipelago on western Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Two of the 
      archaeological sites are located within a marine protected area specifically 
      designed to facilitate the recovery of inshore rockfish populations; two sites 
      are located outside this boundary and remain subject to considerable fishing 
      pressure. Using mitochondrial 16S and control region DNA sequences, we identify 
      at least twelve different rockfish species utilized during the past 2,500 years. 
      Identification of rockfish at closely spaced and contemporaneously occupied sites 
      confirms that a variety of Sebastes species were consistently exploited at each 
      site, with more exposed areas having a higher number of species present. 
      Identification results indicate that four of the twelve species did not occur 
      within the conservation area boundary and, instead, were found in sites where 
      commercial and recreational fishing continues to be permitted. This study 
      demonstrates that ancient DNA identifications of archaeological assemblages can 
      complement and expand perspective on modern day fisheries conservation and 
      management in this National Park Reserve and First Nations ancestral territory.

TI  - Egyptian Canopic Jars at the Crossroad of Medicine and Archaeology: Overview of 
      100 Years of Research and Future Scientific Expectations.
PG  - 267-275
LID - 10.1159/000490797 [doi]
AB  - Ancient Egyptian human remains have been of interest in the fields of both 
      medical and Egyptological research for decades. However, canopic jar holders for 
      internal organs (liver, lungs, stomach, intestines) of Egyptian mummies appear to 
      be but a very occasional source of data for such investigations. The few medical 
      approaches focusing on the content of these jars are summarized and listed 
      according to pathogens and diseases to give a structured overview of this field 
      of study. An extensive search of the literature has been conducted from different 
      bibliographic databases with a total of n = 26 studies found. The majority of 
      diseases found consisted of infectious diseases and internal medicine conditions 
      such as schistosomiasis or emphysema. These are just 2 examples of many that, 
      instead of primarily affecting bone, muscle or skin, specifically target internal 
      organs. Hence, a better understanding of the evolution of diseases that still 
      affect mankind could be gained. In conclusion, this reassessment shows that 
      canopic jars represent a highly underestimated source for histological, 
      radiological and ancient DNA examination of Ancient Egyptian remains and should, 
      thus, be more and more brought back into the focus of retrospective medical 
      research.

TI  - Whole Y-chromosome sequences reveal an extremely recent origin of the most common 
      North African paternal lineage E-M183 (M81).

LID - 15941
AB  - E-M183 (E-M81) is the most frequent paternal lineage in North Africa and thus it 
      must be considered to explore past historical and demographical processes. Here, 
      by using whole Y chromosome sequences from 32 North African individuals, we have 
      identified five new branches within E-M183. The validation of these variants in 
      more than 200 North African samples, from which we also have information of 13 
      Y-STRs, has revealed a strong resemblance among E-M183 Y-STR haplotypes that 
      pointed to a rapid expansion of this haplogroup. Moreover, for the first time, by 
      using both SNP and STR data, we have provided updated estimates of the 
      times-to-the-most-recent-common-ancestor (TMRCA) for E-M183, which evidenced an 
      extremely recent origin of this haplogroup (2,000-3,000 ya). Our results also 
      showed a lack of population structure within the E-M183 branch, which could be 
      explained by the recent and rapid expansion of this haplogroup. In spite of a 
      reduction in STR heterozygosity towards the West, which would point to an origin 
      in the Near East, ancient DNA evidence together with our TMRCA estimates point to 
      a local origin of E-M183 in NW Africa.

TI  - Performance evaluation of a mitogenome capture and Illumina sequencing protocol

AB  - Next-generation ancient DNA technologies have the potential to assist in the 
      analysis of degraded DNA extracted from forensic specimens. Mitochondrial genome 
      (mitogenome) sequencing, specifically, may be of benefit to samples that fail to 
      yield forensically relevant genetic information using conventional PCR-based 
      techniques. This report summarizes the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System's 
      Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory's (AFMES-AFDIL) performance evaluation 
      of a Next-Generation Sequencing protocol for degraded and chemically treated past 
      accounting samples. The procedure involves hybridization capture for targeted 
      enrichment of mitochondrial DNA, massively parallel sequencing using Illumina 
      chemistry, and an automated bioinformatic pipeline for forensic mtDNA profile 
      generation. A total of 22 non-probative samples and associated controls were 
      processed in the present study, spanning a range of DNA quantity and quality. 
      Data were generated from over 100 DNA libraries by ten DNA analysts over the 
      course of five months. The results show that the mitogenome sequencing procedure 
      is reliable and robust, sensitive to low template (one ng control DNA) as well as 
      degraded DNA, and specific to the analysis of the human mitogenome. Haplotypes 
      were overall concordant between NGS replicates and with previously generated 
      Sanger control region data. Due to the inherent risk for contamination when 
      working with low-template, degraded DNA, a contamination assessment was 
      performed. The consumables were shown to be void of human DNA contaminants and 
      suitable for forensic use. Reagent blanks and negative controls were analyzed to 
      determine the background signal of the procedure. This background signal was then 
      used to set analytical and reporting thresholds, which were designated at 4.0X 
      (limit of detection) and 10.0X (limit of quantiation) average coverage across the 
      mitogenome, respectively. Nearly all human samples exceeded the reporting 
      threshold, although coverage was reduced in chemically treated samples resulting 
      in a ∼58% passing rate for these poor-quality samples. A concordance assessment 
      demonstrated the reliability of the NGS data when compared to known Sanger 
      profiles. One case sample was shown to be mixed with a co-processed sample and 
      two reagent blanks indicated the presence of DNA above the analytical threshold. 
      This contamination was attributed to sequencing crosstalk from simultaneously 
      sequenced high-quality samples to include the positive control. Overall this 
      study demonstrated that hybridization capture and Illumina sequencing provide a 
      viable method for mitogenome sequencing of degraded and chemically treated 
      skeletal DNA samples, yet may require alternative measures of quality control.

TI  - Comment: Characterization of Two Historic Smallpox Specimens from a Czech Museum.

AB  - The complete genome sequences of two strains of variola virus (VARV) sampled from 
      human smallpox specimens present in the Czech National Museum, Prague, were 
      recently determined, with one of the sequences estimated to date to the mid-19th 
      century. Using molecular clock methods, the authors of this study go on to infer 
      that the currently available strains of VARV share an older common ancestor, at 
      around 1350 AD, than some recent estimates based on other archival human samples. 
      Herein, we show that the two Czech strains exhibit anomalous branch lengths given 
      their proposed age, and by assuming a constant rate of evolutionary change across 
      the rest of the VARV phylogeny estimate that their true age in fact lies between 
      1918 and 1937. We therefore suggest that the age of the common ancestor of 
      currently available VARV genomes most likely dates to late 16th and early 17th 
      centuries and not ~1350 AD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the Y-chromosomal genetic types for the soldier's remains 
      from Huaihai Campaign, and to offer a clue for search of their paternal 
      relatives. METHODS: DNA of the remains were extracted by the ancient DNA 
      extraction method. Yfiler kit was used for the multiplex amplification of 17 
      Y-STR loci. The haplogroups of the samples were speculated. Detailed genotyping 
      of the selected Y-SNP was performed based on the latest Y-chromosome phylogenetic 
      tree. Haplotype-sharing analysis was done based on the data of Y-SNP and Y-STR, 
      the closest modern individual information to the genetic relationship of remains 
      was gained. RESULTS: A total of 8 Y-STR haplotypes were observed on 17 Y-STR loci 
      of 8 male individuals. Furthermore, 6 Y-SNP haplogroups were identified, which 
      were O2a1-M95+, O1a1-P203+, O3*-M122+/M234-, D1-M15+, C3*-ST and R1a1-M17+. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Identification of Y-chromosomal genetic types for the soldier's 
      remains from Huaihai Campaign shows a reference value on inferring the 
      geographical origins of old materials.

AB  - We present ancient mitochondrial DNA analyses of 31 complete cytochrome b gene 
      sequences from subfossil red deer remains from the Tyrrhenian islands (Corsica 
      and Sardinia) and mainland Italy in a European-wide phylogeographic framework. 
      Tyrrhenian and North African red deer, both going back to human introductions, 
      were previously the only red deer to harbour the mitochondrial B lineage whose 
      origin, however, remained unknown. Our ancient Italian samples from the central 
      part of the peninsula that were radiocarbon-dated to an age of ca. 6300 to 15 
      600 cal BP all showed B haplotypes, closely related or even identical to those 
      found on Sardinia. Genetic diversity in the mainland population was considerably 
      higher than on the islands. Together with palaeontological evidence our genetic 
      results identify the Italian Peninsula as the ultimate origin of the B lineage 
      and thus the Tyrrhenian and North African red deer. This is in line with previous 
      biogeographic findings that uncovered distinct intraspecific phylogeographic 
      lineages in Italian mammals, underlining Italy's status as a hotspot of European 
      mammalian diversity.

TI  - Quantifying the impact of µCT-scanning of human fossil teeth on ESR age results.
PG  - 205-212
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.23180 [doi]
AB  - Fossil human teeth are nowadays systematically CT-scanned by 
      palaeoanthropologists prior to any further analysis. It has been recently 
      demonstrated that this noninvasive technique has, in most cases, virtually no 
      influence on ancient DNA preservation. However, it may have nevertheless an 
      impact on other techniques, like Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) dating, by 
      artificially ageing the apparent age of the sample. To evaluate this impact, we 
      µCT-scanned several modern enamel fragments following the standard analytical 
      procedures employed by the Dental Anthropology Group at CENIEH, Spain, and then 
      performed ESR dose reconstruction for each of them. The results of our experiment 
      demonstrate that the systematic high-resolution µCT-scanning of fossil hominin 
      remains introduces a nonnegligible X-ray dose into the tooth enamel, equivalent 
      to 15-30 Gy depending on the parameters used. This dose may be multiplied by a 
      factor of ∼8 if no metallic filter is used. However, this dose estimate cannot be 
      universally extrapolated to any µCT-scan experiment but has instead to be 
      specifically assessed for each device and set of parameters employed. The impact 
      on the ESR age results is directly dependent on the magnitude of the geological 
      dose measured in fossil enamel but could potentially lead to an age 
      overestimation up to 40% in case of Late Pleistocene samples, if not taken into 
      consideration.

TI  - The Identification of a 1916 Irish Rebel: New Approach for Estimating Relatedness 
      From Low Coverage Homozygous Genomes.
PG  - 41529
LID - 10.1038/srep41529 [doi]
LID - 41529
AB  - Thomas Kent was an Irish rebel who was executed by British forces in the 
      aftermath of the Easter Rising armed insurrection of 1916 and buried in a shallow 
      grave on Cork prison's grounds. In 2015, ninety-nine years after his death, a 
      state funeral was offered to his living family to honor his role in the struggle 
      for Irish independence. However, inaccuracies in record keeping did not allow the 
      bodily remains that supposedly belonged to Kent to be identified with absolute 
      certainty. Using a novel approach based on homozygous single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms, we identified these remains to be those of Kent by comparing his 
      genetic data to that of two known living relatives. As the DNA degradation found 
      on Kent's DNA, characteristic of ancient DNA, rendered traditional methods of 
      relatedness estimation unusable, we forced all loci homozygous, in a process we 
      refer to as "forced homozygote approach". The results were confirmed using 
      simulated data for different relatedness classes. We argue that this method 
      provides a necessary alternative for relatedness estimations, not only in 
      forensic analysis, but also in ancient DNA studies, where reduced amounts of 
      genetic information can limit the application of traditional methods.

TI  - Tropical ancient DNA reveals relationships of the extinct Bahamian giant tortoise 
      Chelonoidis alburyorum.

LID - 20162235
AB  - Ancient DNA of extinct species from the Pleistocene and Holocene has provided 
      valuable evolutionary insights. However, these are largely restricted to mammals 
      and high latitudes because DNA preservation in warm climates is typically poor. 
      In the tropics and subtropics, non-avian reptiles constitute a significant part 
      of the fauna and little is known about the genetics of the many extinct reptiles 
      from tropical islands. We have reconstructed the near-complete mitochondrial 
      genome of an extinct giant tortoise from the Bahamas (Chelonoidis alburyorum) 
      using an approximately 1 000-year-old humerus from a water-filled sinkhole (blue 
      hole) on Great Abaco Island. Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses place this 
      extinct species as closely related to Galápagos (C. niger complex) and Chaco 
      tortoises (C. chilensis), and provide evidence for repeated overseas dispersal in 
      this tortoise group. The ancestors of extant Chelonoidis species arrived in South 
      America from Africa only after the opening of the Atlantic Ocean and dispersed 
      from there to the Caribbean and the Galápagos Islands. Our results also suggest 
      that the anoxic, thermally buffered environment of blue holes may enhance DNA 
      preservation, and thus are opening a window for better understanding evolution 
      and population history of extinct tropical species, which would likely still 
      exist without human impact.

TI  - Admixture and Ancestry Inference from Ancient and Modern Samples through Measures 
      of Population Genetic Drift.
PG  - 21-46
AB  - Methods that leverage the information about population history contained within 
      the increasingly abundant genetic sequences of extant and extinct hominid 
      populations are diverse in form and versatile in application. Here, we review key 
      methods recently developed to detect and quantify admixture and ancestry in 
      modern human populations. We begin with an overview of the f- and D-statistics, 
      covering their conceptual principles and important applications, as well as any 
      extensions developed for them. We then cover a combination of more recent and 
      more complex methods for admixture and ancestry inference, discussing tests for 
      direct ancestry between two populations, quantification of admixture in large 
      data sets, and determination of admixture dates. These methods have 
      revolutionized our understanding of human population history and highlight its 
      complexity. Therefore, we emphasize that current methods may not capture this 
      population history in its entirety but nonetheless provide a reasonable picture 
      that is supported by data from multiple methods and from the historical record.

AB  - The mantra that dietary (saturated) fat must be minimized to reduce 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has dominated nutritional guidelines for 
      decades. Parallel to decreasing intakes of fat and saturated fatty acids (SFA), 
      there have been increases in carbohydrate and sugar intakes, overweight, obesity 
      and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The "lipid hypothesis" coined the concept that fat, 
      especially SFA, raises blood low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and thereby CVD 
      risk. In view of current controversies regarding their adequate intakes and 
      effects, this review aims to summarize research regarding this heterogenic group 
      of fatty acids and the mechanisms relating them to (chronic) systemic low-grade 
      inflammation, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and notably CVD. The 
      intimate relationship between inflammation and metabolism, including glucose, fat 
      and cholesterol metabolism, revealed that the dyslipidemia in Western societies, 
      notably increased triglycerides, "small dense" low-density lipoprotein and 
      "dysfunctional" high-density lipoprotein, is influenced by many unfavorable 
      lifestyle factors. Dietary SFA is only one of these, not necessarily the most 
      important, in healthy, insulin-sensitive people. The environment provides us not 
      only with many other proinflammatory stimuli than SFA but also with many 
      antiinflammatory counterparts. Resolution of the conflict between our 
      self-designed environment and ancient genome may rather rely on returning to the 
      proinflammatory/antiinflammatory balance of the Paleolithic era in consonance 
      with the 21st century culture. Accordingly, dietary guidelines might reconsider 
      recommendations for SFA replacement and investigate diet in a broader context, 
      together with nondietary lifestyle factors. This should be a clear priority, 
      opposed to the reductionist approach of studying the effects of single nutrients, 
      such as SFA.

TI  - Single-strand DNA library preparation improves sequencing of formalin-fixed and 
      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cancer DNA.
PG  - 59115-59128
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.10827 [doi]
AB  - DNA derived from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue has been a 
      challenge to large-scale genomic sequencing, due to its low quality and 
      quantities. Improved techniques enabling the genome-wide analysis of FFPE 
      material would be of great value, both from a research and clinical 
      perspective.Comparing a single-strand DNA library preparation method originally 
      developed for ancient DNA to conventional protocols using double-stranded DNA 
      derived from FFPE material we obtain on average 900-fold more library molecules 
      and improved sequence complexity from as little as 5 ng input DNA. FFPE DNA is 
      highly fragmented, usually below 100bp, and up to 60% of reads start after or end 
      prior to adenine residues, suggesting that crosslinks predominate at adenine 
      residues. Similar to ancient DNA, C > T substitutions are slightly increased with 
      maximum rates up to 3% at the ends of molecules. In whole exome sequencing of 
      single-strand libraries from lung, breast, colorectal, prostate and skin cancers 
      we identify known cancer mutations. In summary, we show that single-strand 
      library preparation enables genomic sequencing, even from low amounts of degraded 
      FFPE DNA. This method provides a clear advantage both in research and clinical 
      settings, where FFPE material (e.g. from biopsies) often is the only source of 
      DNA available. Improving the genetic characterization that can be performed on 
      conventional archived FFPE tissue, the single-strand library preparation allows 
      scarce samples to be used in personalized medicine and enables larger sample 
      sizes in future sequencing studies.

TI  - Human-mediated extirpation of the unique Chatham Islands sea lion and 
      implications for the conservation management of remaining New Zealand sea lion 
      populations.
PG  - 3950-61
LID - 10.1111/mec.13726 [doi]
AB  - While terrestrial megafaunal extinctions have been well characterized worldwide, 
      our understanding of declines in marine megafauna remains limited. Here, we use 
      ancient DNA analyses of prehistoric (<1450-1650 AD) sea lion specimens from New 
      Zealand's isolated Chatham Islands to assess the demographic impacts of human 
      settlement. These data suggest there was a large population of sea lions, unique 
      to the Chatham Islands, at the time of Polynesian settlement. This distinct 
      mitochondrial lineage became rapidly extinct within 200 years due to overhunting, 
      paralleling the extirpation of a similarly large endemic mainland population. 
      Whole mitogenomic analyses confirm substantial intraspecific diversity among 
      prehistoric lineages. Demographic models suggest that even low harvest rates 
      would likely have driven rapid extinction of these lineages. This study indicates 
      that surviving Phocarctos populations are remnants of a once diverse and 
      widespread sea lion assemblage, highlighting dramatic human impacts on endemic 
      marine biodiversity. Our findings also suggest that Phocarctos bycatch in 
      commercial fisheries may contribute to the ongoing population decline.

TI  - Ancient and modern DNA reveal dynamics of domestication and cross-continental 
      dispersal of the dromedary.
PG  - 6707-12
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1519508113 [doi]
AB  - Dromedaries have been fundamental to the development of human societies in arid 
      landscapes and for long-distance trade across hostile hot terrains for 3,000 y. 
      Today they continue to be an important livestock resource in marginal 
      agro-ecological zones. However, the history of dromedary domestication and the 
      influence of ancient trading networks on their genetic structure have remained 
      elusive. We combined ancient DNA sequences of wild and early-domesticated 
      dromedary samples from arid regions with nuclear microsatellite and mitochondrial 
      genotype information from 1,083 extant animals collected across the species' 
      range. We observe little phylogeographic signal in the modern population, 
      indicative of extensive gene flow and virtually affecting all regions except East 
      Africa, where dromedary populations have remained relatively isolated. In 
      agreement with archaeological findings, we identify wild dromedaries from the 
      southeast Arabian Peninsula among the founders of the domestic dromedary gene 
      pool. Approximate Bayesian computations further support the "restocking from the 
      wild" hypothesis, with an initial domestication followed by introgression from 
      individuals from wild, now-extinct populations. Compared with other livestock, 
      which show a long history of gene flow with their wild ancestors, we find a high 
      initial diversity relative to the native distribution of the wild ancestor on the 
      Arabian Peninsula and to the brief coexistence of early-domesticated and wild 
      individuals. This study also demonstrates the potential to retrieve ancient DNA 
      sequences from osseous remains excavated in hot and dry desert environments.

TI  - Tracing the locality of prisoners and workers at the Mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang: 
      First Emperor of China (259-210 BC).

AB  - The mausoleum complex of the First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang (259-210 BC), 
      is one of the most famous and important archaeological sites in China, yet 
      questions remain as to how it was constructed and by whom. Here we present 
      isotopic results of individuals from the Liyi (n = 146) and Shanren sites 
      (n = 14), both associated with the mausoleum complex. Those buried at Liyi 
      represent the local workers/inhabitants of the Qin population, and the δ(13)C 
      (-8.7 ± 1.5%) and δ(15)N (10.3 ± 0.7%) values indicate that they consumed 
      predominately millet and/or domestic animals fed millet. In contrast, the Shanren 
      individuals were prisoners forced to construct the mausoleum (found buried 
      haphazardly in a mass grave and some in iron leg shackles), and their δ(13)C 
      (-15.4 ± 2.9%) and δ(15)N (8.0 ± 0.6%) results indicate a more mixed C3/C4 diet, 
      with possibly less domestic animals and more wild game protein consumed. This 
      pattern of decreased millet consumption is also characteristic of archaeological 
      sites from southern China, and possible evidence the Shanren prisoners originated 
      from this region (possibly the ancient Chu state located in modern day Hubei 
      Province and parts of Hunan and Anhui Provinces). Further, this finding is in 
      agreement with historical sources and is supported by previous ancient DNA 
      evidence that the mausoleum workers had diverse origins, with many genetically 
      related to southern Chinese groups.

TI  - The more the merrier? How a few SNPs predict pigmentation phenotypes in the 
      Northern German population.
PG  - 739-47
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2015.167 [doi]
AB  - Human pigmentation traits are of great interest to many research areas, from 
      ancient DNA analysis to forensic science. We developed a gene-based predictive 
      model for pigmentation phenotypes in a realistic target population for forensic 
      case work from Northern Germany and compared our model with those brought forth 
      by previous studies of genetically more heterogeneous populations. In doing so, 
      we aimed at answering the following research questions: (1) do existing models 
      allow good prediction of high-quality phenotypes in a genetically similar albeit 
      more homogeneous population? (2) Would a model specifically set up for the more 
      homogeneous population perform notably better than existing models? (3) Can the 
      number of markers included in existing models be reduced without compromising 
      their predictive capability in the more homogenous population? We investigated 
      the association between eye, hair and skin colour and 12 candidate 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from six genes. Our study comprised two 
      samples of 300 and 100 individuals from Northern Germany. SNP rs12913832 in HERC2 
      was found to be strongly associated with blue eye colour (odds ratio=40.0, P<1.2 
      × 10(-4)) and to yield moderate predictive power (AUC: 77%; sensitivity: 90%, 
      specificity: 63%, both at a 0.5 threshold for blue eye colour probability). SNP 
      associations with hair and skin colour were weaker and genotypes less predictive. 
      A comparison with two recently published sets of markers to predict eye and hair 
      colour revealed that the consideration of additional SNPs with weak-to-moderate 
      effect increased the predictive power for eye colour, but not for hair colour.

TI  - Targeted capture in evolutionary and ecological genomics.
PG  - 185-202
LID - 10.1111/mec.13304 [doi]
AB  - The rapid expansion of next-generation sequencing has yielded a powerful array of 
      tools to address fundamental biological questions at a scale that was 
      inconceivable just a few years ago. Various genome-partitioning strategies to 
      sequence select subsets of the genome have emerged as powerful alternatives to 
      whole-genome sequencing in ecological and evolutionary genomic studies. 
      High-throughput targeted capture is one such strategy that involves the parallel 
      enrichment of preselected genomic regions of interest. The growing use of 
      targeted capture demonstrates its potential power to address a range of research 
      questions, yet these approaches have yet to expand broadly across laboratories 
      focused on evolutionary and ecological genomics. In part, the use of targeted 
      capture has been hindered by the logistics of capture design and implementation 
      in species without established reference genomes. Here we aim to (i) increase the 
      accessibility of targeted capture to researchers working in nonmodel taxa by 
      discussing capture methods that circumvent the need of a reference genome, (ii) 
      highlight the evolutionary and ecological applications where this approach is 
      emerging as a powerful sequencing strategy and (iii) discuss the future of 
      targeted capture and other genome-partitioning approaches in the light of the 
      increasing accessibility of whole-genome sequencing. Given the practical 
      advantages and increasing feasibility of high-throughput targeted capture, we 
      anticipate an ongoing expansion of capture-based approaches in evolutionary and 
      ecological research, synergistic with an expansion of whole-genome sequencing.

TI  - Model misspecification confounds the estimation of rates and exaggerates their 
      time dependency.
PG  - 6013-20
LID - 10.1111/mec.13451 [doi]
AB  - While welcoming the comment of Ho et al. (2015), we find little that undermines 
      the strength of our criticism, and it would appear they have misunderstood our 
      central argument. Here we respond with the purpose of reiterating that we are (i) 
      generally critical of much of the evidence presented in support of the 
      time-dependent molecular rate (TDMR) hypothesis and (ii) specifically critical of 
      estimates of μ derived from tip-dated sequences that exaggerate the importance of 
      purifying selection as an explanation for TDMR over extended timescales. In 
      response to assertions put forward by Ho et al. (2015), we use panmictic 
      coalescent simulations of temporal data to explore a fundamental assumption for 
      tip-dated tree shape and associated mutation rate estimates, and the 
      appropriateness and utility of the date randomization test. The results reveal 
      problems for the joint estimation of tree topology, effective population size and 
      μ with tip-dated sequences using BEAST. Given the simulations, BEAST consistently 
      obtains incorrect topological tree structures that are consistent with the 
      substantial overestimation of μ and underestimation of effective population size. 
      Data generated from lower effective population sizes were less likely to fail the 
      date randomization test yet still resulted in substantially upwardly biased 
      estimates of rates, bringing previous estimates of μ from temporally sampled DNA 
      sequences into question. We find that our general criticisms of both the 
      hypothesis of time-dependent molecular evolution and Bayesian methods to estimate 
      μ from temporally sampled DNA sequences are further reinforced.

AB  - We are writing in response to a recent critique by Emerson & Hickerson (2015), 
      who challenge the evidence of a time-dependent bias in molecular rate estimates. 
      This bias takes the form of a negative relationship between inferred evolutionary 
      rates and the ages of the calibrations on which these estimates are based. Here, 
      we present a summary of the evidence obtained from a broad range of taxa that 
      supports a time-dependent bias in rate estimates, with a consideration of the 
      potential causes of these observed trends. We also describe recent progress in 
      improving the reliability of evolutionary rate estimation and respond to the 
      concerns raised by Emerson & Hickerson (2015) about the validity of rates 
      estimated from time-structured sequence data. In doing so, we hope to dispel some 
      misconceptions and to highlight several research directions that will improve our 
      understanding of time-dependent biases in rate estimates.

AB  - The ITAM-bearing transmembrane signaling subunits (TSS) are indispensable 
      components of activating leukocyte receptor complexes. The TSS-encoding genes map 
      to paralogous chromosomal regions, which are thought to arise from ancient genome 
      tetraploidization(s). To assess a possible role of tetraploidization in the TSS 
      evolution, we studied TSS and other functionally linked genes in the amphibian 
      species Xenopus laevis whose genome was duplicated about 40 MYR ago. We found 
      that X. laevis has retained a duplicated set of sixteen TSS genes, all except one 
      being transcribed. Furthermore, duplicated TCRα loci and genes encoding 
      TSS-coupling protein kinases have also been retained. No clear evidence for 
      functional divergence of the TSS paralogs was obtained from gene expression and 
      sequence analyses. We suggest that the main factor of maintenance of duplicated 
      TSS genes in X. laevis was a protein dosage effect and that this effect might 
      have facilitated the TSS set expansion in early vertebrates.

AB  - Unravelling prehistoric anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity represents a key 
      challenge for biologists and archaeologists. New Zealand's endemic Stewart Island 
      Shag (Leucocarbo chalconotus) comprises two distinct phylogeographic lineages, 
      currently restricted to the country's south and southeast. However, fossil and 
      archaeological remains suggest a far more widespread distribution at the time of 
      Polynesian settlement ca. 1280 AD, encompassing much of coastal South Island. We 
      used modern and ancient DNA, radiocarbon dating, and Bayesian modelling, to 
      assess the impacts of human arrival on this taxon. Our analyses show that the 
      southeast South Island (Otago) lineage was formerly widespread across coastal 
      South Island, but experienced dramatic population extinctions, range retraction 
      and lineage loss soon after human arrival. By comparison, the southernmost 
      (Foveaux Strait) lineage has experienced a relatively stable demographic and 
      biogeographic history since human arrival, retaining much of its mitochondrial 
      diversity. Archaeological data suggest that these contrasting demographic 
      histories (retraction vs. stability) reflect differential human impacts in 
      mainland South Island vs. Foveaux Strait, highlighting the importance of testing 
      for temporal and spatial variation in human-driven faunal declines.

AB  - There is growing consensus that we have entered the Anthropocene, a geologic 
      epoch characterized by human domination of the ecosystems of the Earth. With the 
      future uncertain, we are faced with understanding how global biodiversity will 
      respond to anthropogenic perturbations. The archaeological record provides 
      perspective on human-environment relations through time and across space. Ancient 
      DNA (aDNA) analyses of plant and animal remains from archaeological sites are 
      particularly useful for understanding past human-environment interactions, which 
      can help guide conservation decisions during the environmental changes of the 
      Anthropocene. Here, we define the emerging field of conservation archaeogenomics, 
      which integrates archaeological and genomic data to generate baselines or 
      benchmarks for scientists, managers, and policy-makers by evaluating climatic and 
      human impacts on past, present, and future biodiversity.

LID - 10.1126/science.aac4315 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms of Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions remain fiercely 
      contested, with human impact or climate change cited as principal drivers. We 
      compared ancient DNA and radiocarbon data from 31 detailed time series of 
      regional megafaunal extinctions and replacements over the past 56,000 years with 
      standard and new combined records of Northern Hemisphere climate in the Late 
      Pleistocene. Unexpectedly, rapid climate changes associated with interstadial 
      warming events are strongly associated with the regional replacement or 
      extinction of major genetic clades or species of megafauna. The presence of many 
      cryptic biotic transitions before the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary revealed by 
      ancient DNA confirms the importance of climate change in megafaunal population 
      extinctions and suggests that metapopulation structures necessary to survive such 
      repeated and rapid climatic shifts were susceptible to human impacts.

AB  - The question of pre-neolithic tuberculosis is still open in paleopathological 
      perspective. One of the major interests is to explore what type of infection 
      could have existed around the early stage of animal domestication. 
      Paleopathological lesions evoking skeletal TB were observed on five human 
      skeletons coming from two PPNB sites in Syria, which belongs to the geographical 
      cradle of agriculture. These sites represent respectively pre-domestication phase 
      (Dja'de el Mughara, Northern Syria, 8800-8300 BCE cal.) and early domestication 
      phase (Tell Aswad, Southern Syria, 8200-7600 BCE cal.). MicroCT scan analyses 
      were performed on two specimens (one per site) and revealed microscopic changes 
      in favor of TB infection. Detection of lipid biomarkers is positive for two 
      specimens (one per site). Initial molecular analysis further indicates the 
      presence of TB in one individual from Dja'de. Interestingly, no morphological 
      evidence of TB was observed on animal remains of wild and newly domesticated 
      species, discovered in these sites. These observations strongly suggest the 
      presence of human tuberculosis before domestication and at its early stages.

AB  - This study investigates whether variants in dental morphology and nuclear DNA 
      provide similar patterns of intergroup affinity among regional populations using 
      biological distance (biodistance) estimates. Many biodistance studies of 
      archaeological populations use skeletal variants in lieu of ancient DNA, based on 
      the widely accepted assumption of a strong correlation between phenetic- and 
      genetic-based affinities. Within studies of dental morphology, this assumption 
      has been well supported by research on a global scale but remains unconfirmed at 
      a more geographically restricted scale. Paired genetic (42 microsatellite loci) 
      and dental (nine crown morphology traits) data were collected from 295 
      individuals among four contemporary Kenyan populations, two of which are known 
      ethnically as "Swahili" and two as "Taita;" all have well-documented population 
      histories. The results indicate that biodistances based on genetic data are 
      correlated with those obtained from dental morphology. Specifically, both 
      distance matrices indicate that the closest affinities are between population 
      samples within each ethnic group. Both also identify greater divergence among 
      samples from the different ethnic groups. However, for this particular study the 
      genetic data may provide finer resolution at detecting overall among-population 
      relationships.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The tuberculosis (TB) situation in Russia is aggravated by the 
      emergence and the spread of multidrug-resistant strains, HIV co-infection and 
      drawbacks in the health control system. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis population 
      structure in Russia has been defined by the remarkable mass migration in the 20th 
      century, the variable genetic background of different ethnic groups inhabiting 
      Russia, and by the pathobiology of circulating strains. Here, I will review the 
      phylogeography and pathobiology of: (i) the dominating Beijing family; (ii) the 
      Latin-American Mediterranean (LAM) family, the second largest in Russia and 
      MDR-associated in some regions; and (iii) the Ural family, endemic in Russia and 
      thought to be less transmissible and drug resistant. REVIEW AND ANALYSIS: M. 
      tuberculosis variant Beijing В0/W148 is regarded as a successful clone of M. 
      tuberculosis widespread in the former Soviet Union. However, a closer look 
      reveals a peculiar clinal gradient of its geographic distribution; it peaks in 
      Siberia and, to a lesser extent, in the European part of the former USSR. In 
      contrast, its rate is sharply decreased in the Asian part of the former Soviet 
      Union, and it is absent in the autochthonous populations elsewhere in the world. 
      Two interdependent hypotheses will be put forward. First, B0/W148 likely 
      originated in Siberia and its primary dispersal was driven by a massive 
      population outflow from Siberia to European Russia in the period 1960-1980. 
      Second, a historically recent phylogenetically demonstrated successful 
      dissemination of the Beijing B0/W148 strain was triggered by an advent and wide 
      use of the modern anti-TB drugs and was due to its remarkable capacity to acquire 
      drug resistance. Robust phylogenetic markers were used to study the evolution of 
      LAM and its major sublineages in Russia and its neighboring countries. A total of 
      250 M. tuberculosis isolates were assigned to LAM based on analysis of 
      LAM-specific SNP in Rv3062 and Rv0129c. The family status was rectified for 121 
      isolates mis-assigned by spoligotyping to non-LAM families (T1 or T5-RUS1). The 
      re-estimated LAM rate increased twofold in Russia and Kazakhstan and fourfold in 
      Belarus. The majority (>90%) of LAM isolates from all three countries belonged to 
      the LAM-RUS sublineage. In contrast, Ibero-American LAM RD-Rio sublineage was 
      identified in only 7 Russian isolates. These findings and further analysis 
      suggest a monophyletic origin of the LAM-RUS subfamily that is endemic in Russia. 
      In contrast, rare LAM RD-Rio isolates were likely brought to Russia through 
      occasional human contact. The analysis of the Ural family showed its highest 
      prevalence in the North/East Pontic (Black Sea) area that may have been an area 
      of its origin and primary dispersal. Ural family strains are not marked by 
      increased pathogenic capacities, association with drug resistance (although there 
      is a trend towards MDR Ural strains in the European part of the former USSR) or 
      increased transmissibility. This reflects their basically low contagiosity which 
      is why the Ural family is still moderately widespread in central Eurasia. 
      Large-scale SNP or WGS population-based studies targeting strains from indigenous 
      populations and, eventually, analysis of ancient DNA will better test these 
      hypotheses. Host genetics factors likely play the most prominent role in the 
      differential dissemination of particular M. tuberculosis genotypes.

AB  - Historically, the Carpathian Basin was the final destination for many nomadic 
      peoples who migrated westward from Inner and Central Asia towards Europe. 
      Proto-Hungarians (Steppe Magyars) were among those who came from the East, the 
      Eurasian Steppe in the early middle ages. In order to detect the paternal genetic 
      contribution from nomadic Steppe tribes, we tested 966 samples from Central Asian 
      (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan), Inner Asian (Mongolians and Buryats in Mongolia) and 
      Hungarian-speaking European (Hungarian, Sekler and Csango) populations. We 
      constructed median-joining networks of certain haplogroups in Hungarian-speaking 
      European, and Altaic-speaking Central and Inner Asian populations. We estimated 
      that the possible paternal genetic contribution from the above described 
      populations among contemporary Hungarian speaking populations ranged between 5% 
      and 7.4%. It is lowest among Hungarians from Hungary (5.1%), while higher among 
      Hungarian-speaking groups in Romania, notably Sekler (7.4%) and Csango (6.3%). 
      However, these results represent only an upper limit. Actual Central/Inner Asian 
      admixture might be somewhat lower as some of the related lineages may have come 
      from a common third source. The main haplogroups responsible for the 
      Central/Inner Asian admixture among Hungarians are J2*-M172 (xM47, M67, M12), 
      J2-L24, R1a-Z93; Q-M242 and E-M78. Earlier studies showed very limited Uralic 
      genetic influence among Hungarians, and based on the present study, Altaic/Turkic 
      genetic contribution is also not significant, although significantly higher than 
      the Uralic one. The conclusion of this study is that present-day Hungarian 
      speakers are genetically very similar to neighbouring populations, isolated 
      Hungarian speaking groups having relatively higher presence of Central and Inner 
      Asian genetic elements. At the same time, the reliable historical and genetic 
      conclusions require an extension of the study to a significantly larger database 
      with deep haplogroup resolution, including ancient DNA data.

AB  - The colonization of the human environment by plants, and the consequent evolution 
      of domesticated forms is increasingly being viewed as a co-evolutionary 
      plant-human process that occurred over a long time period, with evidence for the 
      co-evolutionary relationship between plants and humans reaching ever deeper into 
      the hominin past. This developing view is characterized by a change in emphasis 
      on the drivers of evolution in the case of plants. Rather than individual species 
      being passive recipients of artificial selection pressures and ultimately 
      becoming domesticates, entire plant communities adapted to the human environment. 
      This evolutionary scenario leads to systems level genetic expectations from 
      models that can be explored through ancient DNA and Next Generation Sequencing 
      approaches. Emerging evidence suggests that domesticated genomes fit well with 
      these expectations, with periods of stable complex evolution characterized by 
      large amounts of change associated with relatively small selective value, 
      punctuated by periods in which changes in one-half of the plant-hominin 
      relationship cause rapid, low-complexity adaptation in the other. A corollary of 
      a single plant-hominin co-evolutionary process is that clues about the initiation 
      of the domestication process may well lie deep within the hominin lineage.

TI  - Unravelling the complexity of domestication: a case study using morphometrics and 
      ancient DNA analyses of archaeological pigs from Romania.

AB  - Current evidence suggests that pigs were first domesticated in Eastern Anatolia 
      during the ninth millennium cal BC before dispersing into Europe with Early 
      Neolithic farmers from the beginning of the seventh millennium. Recent ancient 
      DNA (aDNA) research also indicates the incorporation of European wild boar into 
      domestic stock during the Neolithization process. In order to establish the 
      timing of the arrival of domestic pigs into Europe, and to test hypotheses 
      regarding the role European wild boar played in the domestication process, we 
      combined a geometric morphometric analysis (allowing us to combine tooth size and 
      shape) of 449 Romanian ancient teeth with aDNA analysis. Our results firstly 
      substantiate claims that the first domestic pigs in Romania possessed the same 
      mtDNA signatures found in Neolithic pigs in west and central Anatolia. Second, we 
      identified a significant proportion of individuals with large molars whose tooth 
      shape matched that of archaeological (likely) domestic pigs. These large 
      'domestic shape' specimens were present from the outset of the Romanian Neolithic 
      (6100-5500 cal BC) through to later prehistory, suggesting a long history of 
      admixture between introduced domestic pigs and local wild boar. Finally, we 
      confirmed a turnover in mitochondrial lineages found in domestic pigs, possibly 
      coincident with human migration into Anatolia and the Levant that occurred in 
      later prehistory.

TI  - Prehistoric genomes reveal the genetic foundation and cost of horse 
      domestication.
PG  - E5661-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1416991111 [doi]
AB  - The domestication of the horse ∼ 5.5 kya and the emergence of mounted riding, 
      chariotry, and cavalry dramatically transformed human civilization. However, the 
      genetics underlying horse domestication are difficult to reconstruct, given the 
      near extinction of wild horses. We therefore sequenced two ancient horse genomes 
      from Taymyr, Russia (at 7.4- and 24.3-fold coverage), both predating the earliest 
      archeological evidence of domestication. We compared these genomes with genomes 
      of domesticated horses and the wild Przewalski's horse and found genetic 
      structure within Eurasia in the Late Pleistocene, with the ancient population 
      contributing significantly to the genetic variation of domesticated breeds. We 
      furthermore identified a conservative set of 125 potential domestication targets 
      using four complementary scans for genes that have undergone positive selection. 
      One group of genes is involved in muscular and limb development, articular 
      junctions, and the cardiac system, and may represent physiological adaptations to 
      human utilization. A second group consists of genes with cognitive functions, 
      including social behavior, learning capabilities, fear response, and 
      agreeableness, which may have been key for taming horses. We also found that 
      domestication is associated with inbreeding and an excess of deleterious 
      mutations. This genetic load is in line with the "cost of domestication" 
      hypothesis also reported for rice, tomatoes, and dogs, and it is generally 
      attributed to the relaxation of purifying selection resulting from the strong 
      demographic bottlenecks accompanying domestication. Our work demonstrates the 
      power of ancient genomes to reconstruct the complex genetic changes that 
      transformed wild animals into their domesticated forms, and the population 
      context in which this process took place.

AB  - After leaving sub-Saharan Africa around 50000-100000 years ago, anatomically 
      modern humans have quickly occupied extremely diverse environments. Human 
      populations were exposed to further environmental changes resulting from cultural 
      innovations, such as the spread of farming, which gave rise to new selective 
      pressures related to pathogen exposures and dietary shifts. In addition to 
      changing the frequency of individual adaptive alleles, natural selection may also 
      shape the overall genetic architecture of adaptive traits. Here, we review recent 
      advances in understanding the genetic architecture of adaptive human phenotypes 
      based on insights from the studies of lactase persistence, skin pigmentation and 
      high-altitude adaptation. These adaptations evolved in parallel in multiple human 
      populations, providing a chance to investigate independent realizations of the 
      evolutionary process. We suggest that the outcome of adaptive evolution is often 
      highly variable even under similar selective pressures. Finally, we highlight a 
      growing need for detecting adaptations that did not follow the classical sweep 
      model and for incorporating new sources of genetic evidence such as information 
      from ancient DNA.

AB  - Horizontal gene transfer in the form of long DNA fragments has changed our view 
      of bacterial evolution. Recently, we discovered that such processes may also 
      occur with the massive amounts of short and damaged DNA in the environment, and 
      even with truly ancient DNA. Although it presently remains unclear how often it 
      takes place in nature, horizontal gene transfer of short and damaged DNA opens up 
      the possibility for genetic exchange across distinct species in both time and 
      space. In this essay, we speculate on the potential evolutionary consequences of 
      this phenomenon. We argue that it may challenge basic assumptions in evolutionary 
      theory; that it may have distant origins in life's history; and that horizontal 
      gene transfer should be viewed as an evolutionary strategy not only preceding but 
      causally underpinning the evolution of sexual reproduction.

AB  - Ancient mummies have captivated a wide variety of audiences for centuries. In 
      order to better understand the evolution and causative features of 
      atherosclerosis, the Horus group is applying modern scientific methods to study 
      ancient mummies. We have used CT scanning to detect calcification in arteries as 
      an indication of the presence of atherosclerosis, and are correlating these 
      results with cultural and lifestyle features of various populations of ancient 
      people as represented by their ancient mummified remains. We are also pursuing 
      related studies of ancient DNA to define genotypes associated with 
      atherosclerotic phenotypes.

TI  - Extinction and recolonization of coastal megafauna following human arrival in New 
      Zealand.
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2014.0097 [doi]
LID - 20140097
AB  - Extinctions can dramatically reshape biological communities. As a case in point, 
      ancient mass extinction events apparently facilitated dramatic new evolutionary 
      radiations of surviving lineages. However, scientists have yet to fully 
      understand the consequences of more recent biological upheaval, such as the 
      megafaunal extinctions that occurred globally over the past 50 kyr. New Zealand 
      was the world's last large landmass to be colonized by humans, and its 
      exceptional archaeological record documents a vast number of vertebrate 
      extinctions in the immediate aftermath of Polynesian arrival approximately AD 
      1280. This recently colonized archipelago thus presents an outstanding 
      opportunity to test for rapid biological responses to extinction. Here, we use 
      ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis to show that extinction of an endemic sea lion 
      lineage (Phocarctos spp.) apparently facilitated a subsequent northward range 
      expansion of a previously subantarctic-limited lineage. This finding parallels a 
      similar extinction-replacement event in penguins (Megadyptes spp.). In both 
      cases, an endemic mainland clade was completely eliminated soon after human 
      arrival, and then replaced by a genetically divergent clade from the remote 
      subantarctic region, all within the space of a few centuries. These data suggest 
      that ecological and demographic processes can play a role in constraining lineage 
      distributions, even for highly dispersive species, and highlight the potential 
      for dynamic biological responses to extinction.

AB  - Genomic methylation is variable under biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. In 
      particular, viral infection is thought to significantly increase genomic 
      methylation with particularly high activity around transposable elements. Here we 
      present the genomic methylation profiles of grains of archaeological barley 
      (Hordeum vulgare) from several strata from a site in southern Egypt, from the 
      Napatan to the Islamic periods (800 BCE - 1812 CE). One sample tested positive 
      for viral infection and exhibits an unusually high degree of genomic methylation 
      compared to the rest. A decreasing trend in global methylation levels according 
      to deposition date shows in-situ de-methylation of 5-methylcytosine, which can be 
      described as a diagenetic process. This is most likely a deamination mediated 
      de-methylation process and is expected to lead to 5 mC > T base modifications in 
      addition to the C > U modifications due to cytosine deamination, so represents a 
      time-dependent process of DNA diagenesis in ancient DNA.

TI  - Reconstruction and in vivo analysis of the extinct tbx5 gene from ancient 
      wingless moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes).
PG  - 75
LID - 10.1186/1471-2148-14-75 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The forelimb-specific gene tbx5 is highly conserved and essential for 
      the development of forelimbs in zebrafish, mice, and humans. Amongst birds, a 
      single order, Dinornithiformes, comprising the extinct wingless moa of New 
      Zealand, are unique in having no skeletal evidence of forelimb-like structures. 
      RESULTS: To determine the sequence of tbx5 in moa, we used a range of PCR-based 
      techniques on ancient DNA to retrieve all nine tbx5 exons and splice sites from 
      the giant moa, Dinornis. Moa Tbx5 is identical to chicken Tbx5 in being able to 
      activate the downstream promotors of fgf10 and ANF. In addition we show that 
      missexpression of moa tbx5 in the hindlimb of chicken embryos results in the 
      formation of forelimb features, suggesting that Tbx5 was fully functional in 
      wingless moa. An alternatively spliced exon 1 for tbx5 that is expressed 
      specifically in the forelimb region was shown to be almost identical between moa 
      and ostrich, suggesting that, as well as being fully functional, tbx5 is likely 
      to have been expressed normally in moa since divergence from their flighted 
      ancestors, approximately 60 mya. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggests that, as in 
      mice, moa tbx5 is necessary for the induction of forelimbs, but is not sufficient 
      for their outgrowth. Moa Tbx5 may have played an important role in the 
      development of moa's remnant forelimb girdle, and may be required for the 
      formation of this structure. Our results further show that genetic changes 
      affecting genes other than tbx5 must be responsible for the complete loss of 
      forelimbs in moa.

TI  - Establishing the validity of domestication genes using DNA from ancient chickens.
PG  - 6184-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1308939110 [doi]
AB  - Modern domestic plants and animals are subject to human-driven selection for 
      desired phenotypic traits and behavior. Large-scale genetic studies of modern 
      domestic populations and their wild relatives have revealed not only the genetic 
      mechanisms underlying specific phenotypic traits, but also allowed for the 
      identification of candidate domestication genes. Our understanding of the 
      importance of these genes during the initial stages of the domestication process 
      traditionally rests on the assumption that robust inferences about the past can 
      be made on the basis of modern genetic datasets. A growing body of evidence from 
      ancient DNA studies, however, has revealed that ancient and even historic 
      populations often bear little resemblance to their modern counterparts. Here, we 
      test the temporal context of selection on specific genetic loci known to 
      differentiate modern domestic chickens from their extant wild ancestors. We 
      extracted DNA from 80 ancient chickens excavated from 12 European archaeological 
      sites, dated from ∼ 280 B.C. to the 18th century A.D. We targeted three unlinked 
      genetic loci: the mitochondrial control region, a gene associated with yellow 
      skin color (β-carotene dioxygenase 2), and a putative domestication gene thought 
      to be linked to photoperiod and reproduction (thyroid-stimulating hormone 
      receptor, TSHR). Our results reveal significant variability in both nuclear 
      genes, suggesting that the commonality of yellow skin in Western breeds and the 
      near fixation of TSHR in all modern chickens took place only in the past 500 y. 
      In addition, mitochondrial variation has increased as a result of recent 
      admixture with exotic breeds. We conclude by emphasizing the perils of inferring 
      the past from modern genetic data alone.

AB  - The human colonization of Remote Oceania remains one of the great feats of 
      exploration in history, proceeding east from Asia across the vast expanse of the 
      Pacific Ocean. Human commensal and domesticated species were widely transported 
      as part of this diaspora, possibly as far as South America. We sequenced 
      mitochondrial control region DNA from 122 modern and 22 ancient chicken specimens 
      from Polynesia and Island Southeast Asia and used these together with Bayesian 
      modeling methods to examine the human dispersal of chickens across this area. We 
      show that specific techniques are essential to remove contaminating modern DNA 
      from experiments, which appear to have impacted previous studies of Pacific 
      chickens. In contrast to previous reports, we find that all ancient specimens and 
      a high proportion of the modern chickens possess a group of unique, closely 
      related haplotypes found only in the Pacific. This group of haplotypes appears to 
      represent the authentic founding mitochondrial DNA chicken lineages transported 
      across the Pacific, and allows the early dispersal of chickens across Micronesia 
      and Polynesia to be modeled. Importantly, chickens carrying this genetic 
      signature persist on several Pacific islands at high frequencies, suggesting that 
      the original Polynesian chicken lineages may still survive. No early South 
      American chicken samples have been detected with the diagnostic Polynesian mtDNA 
      haplotypes, arguing against reports that chickens provide evidence of Polynesian 
      contact with pre-European South America. Two modern specimens from the 
      Philippines carry haplotypes similar to the ancient Pacific samples, providing 
      clues about a potential homeland for the Polynesian chicken.

AB  - One of the grand goals of historical biogeography is to understand how and why 
      species' population sizes and distributions change over time. Multiple types of 
      data drawn from disparate fields, combined into a single modelling framework, are 
      necessary to document changes in a species's demography and distribution, and to 
      determine the drivers responsible for change. Yet truly integrated approaches are 
      challenging and rarely performed. Here, we discuss a modelling framework that 
      integrates spatio-temporal fossil data, ancient DNA, palaeoclimatological 
      reconstructions, bioclimatic envelope modelling and coalescence models in order 
      to statistically test alternative hypotheses of demographic and potential 
      distributional changes for the iconic American bison (Bison bison). Using 
      different assumptions about the evolution of the bioclimatic niche, we generate 
      hypothetical distributional and demographic histories of the species. We then 
      test these demographic models by comparing the genetic signature predicted by 
      serial coalescence against sequence data derived from subfossils and modern 
      populations. Our results supported demographic models that include both climate 
      and human-associated drivers of population declines. This synthetic approach, 
      integrating palaeoclimatology, bioclimatic envelopes, serial coalescence, 
      spatio-temporal fossil data and heterochronous DNA sequences, improves 
      understanding of species' historical biogeography by allowing consideration of 
      both abiotic and biotic interactions at the population level.

LID - 20132167
AB  - Human colonization of the New World is generally believed to have entailed 
      migrations from Siberia across the Bering isthmus. However, the limited 
      archaeological record of these migrations means that details of the timing, cause 
      and rate remain cryptic. Here, we have used a combination of ancient DNA, 14C 
      dating, hydrogen and oxygen isotopes, and collagen sequencing to explore the 
      colonization history of one of the few other large mammals to have successfully 
      migrated into the Americas at this time: the North American elk (Cervus elaphus 
      canadensis), also known as wapiti. We identify a long-term occupation of 
      northeast Siberia, far beyond the species's current Old World distribution. 
      Migration into North America occurred at the end of the last glaciation, while 
      the northeast Siberian source population became extinct only within the last 500 
      years. This finding is congruent with a similar proposed delay in human 
      colonization, inferred from modern human mitochondrial DNA, and suggestions that 
      the Bering isthmus was not traversable during parts of the Late Pleistocene. Our 
      data imply a fundamental constraint in crossing Beringia, placing limits on the 
      age and mode of human settlement in the Americas, and further establish the 
      utility of ancient DNA in palaeontological investigations of species histories.

TI  - Use of pollen and ancient DNA as conservation baselines for offshore islands in 
      New Zealand.
PG  - 202-12

AB  - Islands play a key role globally in the conservation of endemic species. Many 
      island reserves have been highly modified since human colonization, and their 
      restoration and management usually occur without knowledge of their prehuman 
      state. However, conservation paleoecology is increasingly being recognized as a 
      tool that can help to inform both restoration and conservation of island reserves 
      by providing prehuman vegetation baselines. Many of New Zealand's mammal-free 
      offshore islands are foci for biological diversity conservation and, like many 
      islands in the Polynesian region, were deforested following initial human 
      settlement. Therefore, their current restoration, replanting, and management are 
      guided either by historic vegetation descriptions or the occurrence of species on 
      forested islands. We analyzed pollen and ancient DNA in soil cores from an 
      offshore island in northern New Zealand. The result was a 2000-year record of 
      vegetation change that began >1200 years before human settlement and spanned 550 
      years of human occupation and 180 years of forest succession since human 
      occupation ceased. Between prehuman and contemporary forests there was nearly a 
      complete species turnover including the extirpation of a dominant conifer and a 
      palm tree. The podocarp-dominated forests were replaced by a native but novel 
      angiosperm-dominated forest. There is no modern analog of the prehuman forests on 
      any northern New Zealand island, and those islands that are forested are 
      dominated by angiosperms which are assumed to be climax forests. The pollen and 
      DNA evidence for conifer- and palm-rich forests in the prehuman era challenge 
      this climax forest assumption. Prehuman vegetation records can thus help to 
      inform future restoration of degraded offshore islands by informing the likely 
      rate and direction of successional change; helping to determine whether natural 
      rates of succession are preferable to more costly replanting programs; and 
      providing past species lists if restoration replanting is desired.

TI  - Ancient mitochondrial genome reveals unsuspected taxonomic affinity of the 
      extinct Chatham duck (Pachyanas chathamica) and resolves divergence times for New 
      Zealand and sub-Antarctic brown teals.

AB  - The Chatham duck (Pachyanas chathamica) represented one of just three modern bird 
      genera endemic to the Chatham archipelago (situated ~850 km east of New Zealand) 
      but became extinct soon after humans first settled the islands (c. 13th-15th 
      centuries AD). The taxonomic affinity of the Chatham duck remains largely 
      unresolved; previous studies have tentatively suggested placements within both 
      Tadornini (shelducks) and Anatini (dabbling ducks). Herein, we sequence a partial 
      mitochondrial genome (excluding the D-loop) from the Chatham duck and discover 
      that it was a phenotypically-divergent species within the genus Anas (Anatini). 
      This conclusion is further supported by a re-examination of osteological 
      characters. Our molecular analyses convincingly demonstrate that the Chatham duck 
      is the most basal member of a sub-clade comprising the New Zealand and 
      sub-Antarctic brown teals (the brown teal [A. chlorotis], Auckland Island teal 
      [A. aucklandica] and Campbell Island teal [A. nesiotis]). Molecular clock 
      calculations based on an ingroup fossil calibration support a divergence between 
      the Chatham duck and its sister-taxa that is consistent with the estimated time 
      of emergence of the Chatham Islands. Additionally, we find that mtDNA divergence 
      between the two sub-Antarctic teal species (A. aucklandica and A. nesiotis) 
      significantly pre-dates the last few glacial cycles, raising interesting 
      questions about the timing of their dispersal to these islands, and the recent 
      phylogeographic history of brown teal lineages in the region.

AB  - Studies of low copy number (LCN) and degraded DNA are prone to contamination from 
      exogenous DNA sources that in some cases out-compete endogenous DNA in PCR 
      amplification, thus leading to false positives and/or aberrant results. 
      Particularly problematic is contamination that is inadvertently deposited on the 
      surfaces of bones through direct handling. Whereas some previous studies have 
      shown that contamination removal is possible by subjecting samples to sodium 
      hypochlorite prior to DNA extraction, others caution that such treatment can 
      destroy a majority of the molecules endogenous to the sample. To further explore 
      this topic, we experimentally contaminated ancient northern fur seal (Callorhinus 
      ursinus) ribs with human DNA and treated them with sodium hypochlorite to remove 
      that contamination. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that found 
      sodium hypochlorite to be highly efficient (~81-99%) at contamination removal; 
      however, there emerged no treatment capable of removing 100% of the contamination 
      across all of the experiments. Moreover, the ability to estimate the degree of 
      damage to endogenous northern fur seal molecules was compromised due to the 
      inherent variability of preserved mtDNA across the bones, and the presence of 
      co-extracted PCR inhibitors.

AB  - Chromatin provides both a means to accommodate a large amount of genetic material 
      in a small space and a means to package the same genetic material in different 
      chromatin states. Transitions between chromatin states are enabled by 
      chromatin-remodeling ATPases, which catalyze a diverse range of structural 
      transformations. Biochemical evidence over the last two decades suggests that 
      chromatin-remodeling activities may have emerged by adaptation of ancient DNA 
      translocases to respond to specific features of chromatin. Here, we discuss such 
      evidence and also relate mechanistic insights to our understanding of how 
      chromatin-remodeling enzymes enable different in vivo processes.

TI  - Lifestyle and nutritional imbalances associated with Western diseases: causes and 
      consequences of chronic systemic low-grade inflammation in an evolutionary 
      context.
PG  - 1183-201
LID - S0955-2863(13)00054-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2013.02.009 [doi]
AB  - In this review, we focus on lifestyle changes, especially dietary habits, that 
      are at the basis of chronic systemic low grade inflammation, insulin resistance 
      and Western diseases. Our sensitivity to develop insulin resistance traces back 
      to our rapid brain growth in the past 2.5 million years. An inflammatory reaction 
      jeopardizes the high glucose needs of our brain, causing various adaptations, 
      including insulin resistance, functional reallocation of energy-rich nutrients 
      and changing serum lipoprotein composition. The latter aims at redistribution of 
      lipids, modulation of the immune reaction, and active inhibition of reverse 
      cholesterol transport for damage repair. With the advent of the agricultural and 
      industrial revolutions, we have introduced numerous false inflammatory triggers 
      in our lifestyle, driving us to a state of chronic systemic low grade 
      inflammation that eventually leads to typically Western diseases via an 
      evolutionary conserved interaction between our immune system and metabolism. The 
      underlying triggers are an abnormal dietary composition and microbial flora, 
      insufficient physical activity and sleep, chronic stress and environmental 
      pollution. The disturbance of our inflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance is 
      illustrated by dietary fatty acids and antioxidants. The current decrease in 
      years without chronic disease is rather due to "nurture" than "nature," since 
      less than 5% of the typically Western diseases are primary attributable to 
      genetic factors. Resolution of the conflict between environment and our ancient 
      genome might be the only effective manner for "healthy aging," and to achieve 
      this we might have to return to the lifestyle of the Paleolithic era as 
      translated to the 21st century culture.

AB  - Phytophthora infestans, the cause of potato late blight, is infamous for having 
      triggered the Irish Great Famine in the 1840s. Until the late 1970s, P. infestans 
      diversity outside of its Mexican center of origin was low, and one scenario held 
      that a single strain, US-1, had dominated the global population for 150 years; 
      this was later challenged based on DNA analysis of historical herbarium 
      specimens. We have compared the genomes of 11 herbarium and 15 modern strains. We 
      conclude that the 19th century epidemic was caused by a unique genotype, HERB-1, 
      that persisted for over 50 years. HERB-1 is distinct from all examined modern 
      strains, but it is a close relative of US-1, which replaced it outside of Mexico 
      in the 20th century. We propose that HERB-1 and US-1 emerged from a 
      metapopulation that was established in the early 1800s outside of the species' 
      center of diversity. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00731.001.

AB  - The origins of the extinct Falkland Islands wolf (FIW), Dusicyon australis, have 
      remained a mystery since it was first recorded by Europeans in the seventeenth 
      century. It is the only terrestrial mammal on the Falkland Islands (also known as 
      the Malvinas Islands), which lie ~460 km from Argentina, leading to suggestions 
      of either human-mediated transport or overwater dispersal. Previous studies used 
      ancient DNA from museum specimens to suggest that the FIW diverged from its 
      closest living relative, the South American maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) 
      around 7 Ma, and colonized the islands ~330 ka by unknown means. Here we retrieve 
      ancient DNA from subfossils of an extinct mainland relative, Dusicyon avus, and 
      reveal the FIW lineage became isolated only 16 ka (8-31 ka), during the last 
      glacial phase. Submarine terraces, formed on the Argentine coastal shelf by low 
      sea-stands during this period, suggest that the FIW colonized via a narrow, 
      shallow marine strait, potentially while it was frozen over.

TI  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
      combined with multidimensional scaling, binary hierarchical cluster tree and 
      selected diagnostic masses improves species identification of Neolithic keratin 
      sequences from furs of the Tyrolean Iceman Oetzi.
PG  - 1735-45
LID - 10.1002/rcm.6277 [doi]
AB  - The identification of fur origins from the 5300-year-old Tyrolean Iceman's 
      accoutrement is not yet complete, although definite identification is essential 
      for the socio-cultural context of his epoch. Neither have all potential samples 
      been identified so far, nor there has a consensus been reached on the species 
      identified using the classical methods. Archaeological hair often lacks 
      analyzable hair scale patterns in microscopic analyses and polymer chain reaction 
      (PCR)-based techniques are often inapplicable due to the lack of amplifiable 
      ancient DNA. To overcome these drawbacks, a matrix-assisted laser 
      desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) method was 
      used exclusively based on hair keratins. Thirteen fur specimens from his 
      accoutrement were analyzed after tryptic digest of native hair. Peptide mass 
      fingerprints (pmfs) from ancient samples and from reference species mostly 
      occurring in the Alpine surroundings at his lifetime were compared to each other 
      using multidimensional scaling and binary hierarchical cluster tree analysis. 
      Both statistical methods highly reflect spectral similarities among pmfs as close 
      zoological relationships. While multidimensional scaling was useful to 
      discriminate specimens on the zoological order level, binary hierarchical cluster 
      tree reached the family or subfamily level. Additionally, the presence and/or 
      absence of order, family and/or species-specific diagnostic masses in their pmfs 
      allowed the identification of mammals mostly down to single species level. Red 
      deer was found in his shoe vamp, goat in the leggings, cattle in his shoe sole 
      and at his quiver's closing flap as well as sheep and chamois in his coat. Canid 
      species, like grey wolf, domestic dog or European red fox, were discovered in his 
      leggings for the first time, but could not be differentiated to species level. 
      This is widening the spectrum of processed fur-bearing species to at least one 
      member of the Canidae family. His fur cap was allocated to a carnivore species, 
      but differentiation between brown bear and a canid species could not be made with 
      certainty.

TI  - Dramatic reduction of sequence artefacts from DNA isolated from formalin-fixed 
      cancer biopsies by treatment with uracil- DNA glycosylase.
PG  - 546-58
AB  - Non-reproducible sequence artefacts are frequently detected in DNA from 
      formalinfixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. However, no rational strategy 
      has been developed for reduction of sequence artefacts from FFPE DNA as the 
      underlying causes of the artefacts are poorly understood. As cytosine deamination 
      to uracil is a common form of DNA damage in ancient DNA, we set out to examine 
      whether treatment of FFPE DNA with uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) would lead to the 
      reduction of C>T (and G>A) sequence artefacts. Heteroduplex formation in high 
      resolution melting (HRM)-based assays was used for the detection of sequence 
      variants in FFPE DNA samples. A set of samples that gave false positive HRM 
      results for screening for the E17K mutation in exon 4 of the AKT1 gene were 
      chosen for analysis. Sequencing of these samples showed multiple non-reproducible 
      C:G>T:A artefacts. Treatment of the FFPE DNA with UDG prior to PCR amplification 
      led to a very marked reduction of the sequence artefacts as indicated by both HRM 
      and sequencing analysis, indicating that uracil lesions are the major cause of 
      sequence artefacts. Similar results were shown for the BRAF V600 region in the 
      same sample set and EGFR exon 19 in another sample set. UDG treatment 
      specifically suppressed the formation of artefacts in FFPE DNA as it did not 
      affect the detection of true KRAS codon 12 and true EGFR exon 19 and 20 
      mutations. We conclude that uracil in FFPE DNA leads to a significant proportion 
      of sequence artefacts. These can be minimised by a simple UDG pretreatment which 
      can be readily carried out, in the same tube, as the PCR immediately prior to 
      commencing thermal cycling. HRM is a convenient way of monitoring both the degree 
      of damage and the effectiveness of the UDG treatment. These findings have 
      immediate and important implications for cancer diagnostics where FFPE DNA is 
      used as the primary genetic material for mutational studies guiding personalised 
      medicine strategies and where simple effective strategies to detect mutations are 
      required.

TI  - Reconstructing ancient mitochondrial DNA links between Africa and Europe.
PG  - 821-6
LID - 10.1101/gr.134452.111 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages of macro-haplogroup L (excluding the derived 
      L3 branches M and N) represent the majority of the typical sub-Saharan mtDNA 
      variability. In Europe, these mtDNAs account for <1% of the total but, when 
      analyzed at the level of control region, they show no signals of having evolved 
      within the European continent, an observation that is compatible with a recent 
      arrival from the African continent. To further evaluate this issue, we analyzed 
      69 mitochondrial genomes belonging to various L sublineages from a wide range of 
      European populations. Phylogeographic analyses showed that ~65% of the European L 
      lineages most likely arrived in rather recent historical times, including the 
      Romanization period, the Arab conquest of the Iberian Peninsula and Sicily, and 
      during the period of the Atlantic slave trade. However, the remaining 35% of L 
      mtDNAs form European-specific subclades, revealing that there was gene flow from 
      sub-Saharan Africa toward Europe as early as 11,000 yr ago.

TI  - Blocking human contaminant DNA during PCR allows amplification of rare mammal 
      species from sedimentary ancient DNA.
PG  - 1806-15

AB  - Analyses of degraded DNA are typically hampered by contamination, especially when 
      employing universal primers such as commonly used in environmental DNA studies. 
      In addition to false-positive results, the amplification of contaminant DNA may 
      cause false-negative results because of competition, or bias, during the PCR. In 
      this study, we test the utility of human-specific blocking primers in mammal 
      diversity analyses of ancient permafrost samples from Siberia. Using quantitative 
      PCR (qPCR) on human and mammoth DNA, we first optimized the design and 
      concentration of blocking primer in the PCR. Subsequently, 454 pyrosequencing of 
      ancient permafrost samples amplified with and without the addition of blocking 
      primer revealed that DNA sequences from a diversity of mammalian representatives 
      of the Beringian megafauna were retrieved only when the blocking primer was added 
      to the PCR. Notably, we observe the first retrieval of woolly rhinoceros 
      (Coelodonta antiquitatis) DNA from ancient permafrost cores. In contrast, 
      reactions without blocking primer resulted in complete dominance by human DNA 
      sequences. These results demonstrate that in ancient environmental analyses, the 
      PCR can be biased towards the amplification of contaminant sequences to such an 
      extent that retrieval of the endogenous DNA is severely restricted. The 
      application of blocking primers is a promising tool to avoid this bias and can 
      greatly enhance the quantity and the diversity of the endogenous DNA sequences 
      that are amplified.

AB  - Scientists seek to use fossil and archaeological evidence to constrain models of 
      the coevolution of human language and tool use. We focus on Neanderthals, for 
      whom indirect evidence from tool use and ancient DNA appears consistent with an 
      adaptation to complex vocal-auditory communication. We summarize existing 
      arguments that the articulatory apparatus for speech had not yet come under 
      intense positive selection pressure in Neanderthals, and we outline some recent 
      evidence and analyses that challenge such arguments. We then provide new 
      anatomical results from our own attempt to reconstruct vocal tract (VT) 
      morphology in Neanderthals, and document our simulations of the acoustic and 
      articulatory potential of this reconstructed Neanderthal VT. Our purpose in this 
      paper is not to polarize debate about whether or not Neanderthals were human-like 
      in all relevant respects, but to contribute to the development of methods that 
      can be used to make further incremental advances in our understanding of the 
      evolution of speech based on fossil and archaeological evidence.

TI  - Investigating the global dispersal of chickens in prehistory using ancient 
      mitochondrial DNA signatures.
PG  - e39171
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0039171 [doi]
LID - e39171
AB  - Data from morphology, linguistics, history, and archaeology have all been used to 
      trace the dispersal of chickens from Asian domestication centers to their current 
      global distribution. Each provides a unique perspective which can aid in the 
      reconstruction of prehistory. This study expands on previous investigations by 
      adding a temporal component from ancient DNA and, in some cases, direct dating of 
      bones of individual chickens from a variety of sites in Europe, the Pacific, and 
      the Americas. The results from the ancient DNA analyses of forty-eight 
      archaeologically derived chicken bones provide support for archaeological 
      hypotheses about the prehistoric human transport of chickens. Haplogroup E mtDNA 
      signatures have been amplified from directly dated samples originating in Europe 
      at 1000 B.P. and in the Pacific at 3000 B.P. indicating multiple prehistoric 
      dispersals from a single Asian centre. These two dispersal pathways converged in 
      the Americas where chickens were introduced both by Polynesians and later by 
      Europeans. The results of this study also highlight the inappropriate application 
      of the small stretch of D-loop, traditionally amplified for use in phylogenetic 
      studies, to understanding discrete episodes of chicken translocation in the past. 
      The results of this study lead to the proposal of four hypotheses which will 
      require further scrutiny and rigorous future testing.

PG  - e40025

AB  - Knowledge about the diet and ecology of extinct herbivores has important 
      implications for understanding the evolution of plant defence structures, 
      establishing the influences of herbivory on past plant community structure and 
      composition, and identifying pollination and seed dispersal syndromes. The 
      flightless ratite moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes) were New Zealand's largest 
      herbivores prior to their extinction soon after initial human settlement. Here we 
      contribute to the knowledge of moa diet and ecology by reporting the results of a 
      multidisciplinary study of 35 coprolites from a subalpine cave (Euphrates Cave) 
      on the South Island of New Zealand. Ancient DNA analysis and radiocarbon dating 
      revealed the coprolites were deposited by the extinct upland moa (Megalapteryx 
      didinus), and span from at least 6,368±31 until 694±30 (14)C years BP; the 
      approximate time of their extinction. Using pollen, plant macrofossil, and 
      ancient DNA analyses, we identified at least 67 plant taxa from the coprolites, 
      including the first evidence that moa fed on the nectar-rich flowers of New 
      Zealand flax (Phormium) and tree fuchsia (Fuchsia excorticata). The plant 
      assemblage from the coprolites reflects a highly-generalist feeding ecology for 
      upland moa, including browsing and grazing across the full range of locally 
      available habitats (spanning southern beech (Nothofagus) forest to tussock 
      (Chionochloa) grassland). Intact seeds in the coprolites indicate that upland moa 
      may have been important dispersal agents for several plant taxa. Plant taxa with 
      putative anti-browse adaptations were also identified in the coprolites. Clusters 
      of coprolites (based on pollen assemblages, moa haplotypes, and radiocarbon 
      dates), probably reflect specimens deposited at the same time by individual 
      birds, and reveal the necessity of suitably large sample sizes in coprolite 
      studies to overcome potential biases in diet interpretation.

TI  - Species-specific responses of Late Quaternary megafauna to climate and humans.
PG  - 359-64
LID - 10.1038/nature10574 [doi]
AB  - Despite decades of research, the roles of climate and humans in driving the 
      dramatic extinctions of large-bodied mammals during the Late Quaternary period 
      remain contentious. Here we use ancient DNA, species distribution models and the 
      human fossil record to elucidate how climate and humans shaped the demographic 
      history of woolly rhinoceros, woolly mammoth, wild horse, reindeer, bison and 
      musk ox. We show that climate has been a major driver of population change over 
      the past 50,000 years. However, each species responds differently to the effects 
      of climatic shifts, habitat redistribution and human encroachment. Although 
      climate change alone can explain the extinction of some species, such as Eurasian 
      musk ox and woolly rhinoceros, a combination of climatic and anthropogenic 
      effects appears to be responsible for the extinction of others, including 
      Eurasian steppe bison and wild horse. We find no genetic signature or any 
      distinctive range dynamics distinguishing extinct from surviving species, 
      emphasizing the challenges associated with predicting future responses of extant 
      mammals to climate and human-mediated habitat change.

TI  - 'Progress' renders detrimental an ancient mitochondrial DNA genetic variant.
PG  - 4224-31

AB  - A human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transition, m.1555A>G, in the 12S rRNA gene 
      causes non-syndromic hearing loss. However, this pathological mutation is the 
      wild-type allele in orangutan mtDNA. Here we rule out different genetic factors 
      as the reason for its fixation in orangutans and show that aminoglycosides 
      negatively affect the oxidative phosphorylation function by decreasing the 
      synthesis of mtDNA-encoded proteins and the amount and activity of respiratory 
      complex IV. These drugs also diminish the growth rate of orangutan cells. The 
      m.1555G nucleotide is also the wild-type allele in other mammal species and they 
      might be at risk of suffering a mitochondrial disorder if treated with 
      aminoglycosides. Therefore, pharmacogenomic approaches should be used to confirm 
      this possibility. These observations are important for human health. Due to the 
      fact that old age and high frequency are criteria widely used in mitochondrial 
      medicine to rule out a genetic change as being a pathological mutation, our 
      results prevent against simplistic genetic approaches that do not consider the 
      potential effect of environmental conditions. Hence, these results suggest that 
      some ancient and highly frequent human population polymorphisms, such as those 
      defining mtDNA haplogroups, in mitochondrial rRNA genes can be deleterious in 
      association with new environmental conditions. Therefore, as the discovery of 
      ribosomal antibiotics has allowed to fight infectious diseases and this 
      breakthrough can be considered an important scientific advance or 'progress', our 
      results suggest that 'progress' can also have a negative counterpart and render 
      detrimental many of these mtDNA genotypes.

TI  - The mummy returns… and sheds new light on old questions.
PG  - 4195-8
AB  - Whether as the ancient Egyptian crocodile-god Sobek, a terrifying predator of 
      African waterways, or simply as a premium handbag leather, the Nile crocodile 
      (Crocodylus niloticus) has long held the fascination of mankind. Despite 200 
      years of study, however, uncertainty remains as to its taxonomy. While resolving 
      such issues are key to understanding the origins and biogeography of the 
      so-called true crocodiles of genus Crocodylus, given widespread ongoing range 
      contraction, such issues are paramount for design of future conservation 
      strategies. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Hekkala et al. (2011) apply 
      analysis of modern, historic and ancient DNA (aDNA) to the questions, with 
      far-reaching implications. First they demonstrate that, as currently described, 
      the Nile crocodile is paraphyletic, with individuals from the east and western 
      clades separated by a number of New World crocodile species. The consequences of 
      this finding are as important for conservation efforts as for their impact on 
      crocodile taxonomy. Furthermore, they strike at the heart of the long-standing 
      debate over whether aDNA analysis of ancient Egyptian mummies is scientifically 
      sound.

TI  - An ancient icon reveals new mysteries: mummy DNA resurrects a cryptic species 
      within the Nile crocodile.
PG  - 4199-215

AB  - The Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is an ancient icon of both cultural and 
      scientific interest. The species is emblematic of the great civilizations of the 
      Nile River valley and serves as a model for international wildlife conservation. 
      Despite its familiarity, a centuries-long dispute over the taxonomic status of 
      the Nile crocodile remains unresolved. This dispute not only confounds our 
      understanding of the origins and biogeography of the 'true crocodiles' of the 
      crown genus Crocodylus, but also complicates conservation and management of this 
      commercially valuable species. We have taken a total evidence approach involving 
      phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear markers, as well as karyotype 
      analysis of chromosome number and structure, to assess the monophyletic status of 
      the Nile crocodile. Samples were collected from throughout Africa, covering all 
      major bioregions. We also utilized specimens from museum collections, including 
      mummified crocodiles from the ancient Egyptian temples at Thebes and the Grottes 
      de Samoun, to reconstruct the genetic profiles of extirpated populations. Our 
      analyses reveal a cryptic evolutionary lineage within the Nile crocodile that 
      elucidates the biogeographic history of the genus and clarifies long-standing 
      arguments over the species' taxonomic identity and conservation status. An 
      examination of crocodile mummy haplotypes indicates that the cryptic lineage 
      corresponds to an earlier description of C. suchus and suggests that both African 
      Crocodylus lineages historically inhabited the Nile River. Recent survey efforts 
      indicate that C. suchus is declining or extirpated throughout much of its 
      distribution. Without proper recognition of this cryptic species, current 
      sustainable use-based management policies for the Nile crocodile may do more harm 
      than good.

TI  - Ancient DNA recovers the origins of Māori feather cloaks.

AB  - Feather cloaks ("kakahu"), particularly those adorned with kiwi feathers, are 
      treasured items or "taonga" to the Māori people of "Aotearoa"/New Zealand. They 
      are considered iconic expression of Māori culture. Despite their status, much of 
      our knowledge of the materials used to construct cloaks, the provenance of 
      cloaks, and the origins of cloak making itself, has been lost. We used ancient 
      DNA methods to recover mitochondrial DNA sequences from 849 feather samples taken 
      from 109 cloaks. We show that almost all (>99%) of the cloaks were constructed 
      using feathers from North Island brown kiwi. Molecular sexing of nuclear DNA 
      recovered from 92 feather cloak samples also revealed that the sex ratio of birds 
      deviated from a ratio of 1:1 observed in reference populations. Additionally, we 
      constructed a database of 185 mitochondrial control region DNA sequences of kiwi 
      feathers comprising samples collected from 26 North Island locations together 
      with data available from the literature. Genetic subdivision (G(ST)), nucleotide 
      subdivision (N(ST)) and Spatial Analysis of Molecular Variants (SAMOVA) analyses 
      revealed high levels of genetic structuring in North Island brown kiwi. Together 
      with sequence data from previously studied ancient and modern kiwi samples, we 
      were able to determine the geographic provenance of 847 cloak feathers from 108 
      cloaks. A surprising proportion (15%) of cloaks were found to contain feathers 
      from different geographic locations, providing evidence of kiwi trading among 
      Māori tribes or organized hunting trips into other tribal areas. Our data also 
      suggest that the east of the North Island of New Zealand was the most prolific of 
      all kiwi cloak making areas, with over 50% of all cloaks analyzed originating 
      from this region. Similar molecular approaches have the potential to discover a 
      wealth of lost information from artifacts of endemic cultures worldwide.

TI  - Beyond ancient microbial DNA: nonnucleotidic biomolecules for paleomicrobiology.
PG  - 370-80
LID - 10.2144/000113689 [doi]
AB  - Identifying the causes of past epidemics depends on the specific detection of 
      pathogens in buried individuals; this field of research is known as 
      paleomicrobiology, an emerging field that has benefited from technological 
      advances in microbiology. For almost 15 years, the detection, identification, and 
      characterization of microbes in ancient environmental and human specimens emerged 
      on the basis of ancient DNA (aDNA) analyses. aDNA limitations due to potential 
      contamination by modern DNA and altered aDNA led to the development of 
      alternative methods for the detection and characterization of nonnucleotidic 
      biomolecules, including mycolic acids (of ancient mycobacteria) and proteins. 
      Accordingly, immunohistochemistry, immunochromatography, and enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay techniques have been developed for the specific detection of 
      microbes from ancient human and environmental specimens. Protein analysis by mass 
      spectrometry, a standard for ancient animal identification, has also recently 
      emerged as a technique for ancient mycobacteria detection, while immuno-PCR is 
      yet another promising technique. As with aDNA, strict protocols must be enforced 
      to ensure authenticity of the data. Here we review the analysis of nonnucleotidic 
      biomolecules from ancient microbes and the ability of these analyses to 
      complement aDNA analyses, which opens new opportunities for identification of 
      ancient microbes as well as new avenues to potentially resolve controversies 
      regarding the cause of some historical pandemics and study the coevolution of 
      microbes and hosts.

TI  - New insights in the removal of the hydantoins, oxidation product of pyrimidines, 
      via the base excision and nucleotide incision repair pathways.
PG  - e21039
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0021039 [doi]
LID - e21039
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative damage to DNA, if not repaired, can be both miscoding and 
      blocking. These genetic alterations can lead to mutations and/or cell death, 
      which in turn cause cancer and aging. Oxidized DNA bases are substrates for two 
      overlapping repair pathways: base excision (BER) and nucleotide incision repair 
      (NIR). Hydantoin derivatives such as 5-hydroxyhydantoin (5OH-Hyd) and 
      5-methyl-5-hydroxyhydantoin (5OH-5Me-Hyd), major products of cytosine and thymine 
      oxidative degradation pathways, respectively, have been detected in cancer cells 
      and ancient DNA. Hydantoins are blocking lesions for DNA polymerases and excised 
      by bacterial and yeast DNA glycosylases in the BER pathway. However little is 
      known about repair of pyrimidine-derived hydantoins in human cells. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, using both denaturing PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS 
      analyses we report that the bacterial, yeast and human AP endonucleases can 
      incise duplex DNA 5' next to 5OH-Hyd and 5OH-5Me-Hyd thus initiating the NIR 
      pathway. We have fully reconstituted the NIR pathway for these lesions in vitro 
      using purified human proteins. Depletion of Nfo in E. coli and APE1 in HeLa cells 
      abolishes the NIR activity in cell-free extracts. Importantly, a number of 
      redundant DNA glycosylase activities can excise hydantoin residues, including 
      human NTH1, NEIL1 and NEIL2 and the former protein being a major DNA glycosylase 
      activity in HeLa cells extracts. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study 
      demonstrates that both BER and NIR pathways can compete and/or back-up each other 
      to remove hydantoin DNA lesions in vivo.

PG  - 975-8
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msq083 [doi]
AB  - The causes of the late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions are still enigmatic. 
      Although the fossil record can provide approximations for when a species went 
      extinct, the timing of its disappearance alone cannot resolve the causes and mode 
      of the decline preceding its extinction. However, ancient DNA analyses can reveal 
      population size changes over time and narrow down potential causes of extinction. 
      Here, we present an ancient DNA study comparing late Pleistocene population 
      dynamics of two closely related species, cave and brown bears. We found that the 
      decline of cave bears started approximately 25,000 years before their extinction, 
      whereas brown bear population size remained constant. We conclude that neither 
      the effects of climate change nor human hunting alone can be responsible for the 
      decline of the cave bear and suggest that a complex of factors including human 
      competition for cave sites lead to the cave bear's extinction.

TI  - Ancient DNA analyses exclude humans as the driving force behind late Pleistocene 
      musk ox (Ovibos moschatus) population dynamics.
PG  - 5675-80
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0907189107 [doi]
AB  - The causes of the late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions are poorly understood. 
      Different lines of evidence point to climate change, the arrival of humans, or a 
      combination of these events as the trigger. Although many species went extinct, 
      others, such as caribou and bison, survived to the present. The musk ox has an 
      intermediate story: relatively abundant during the Pleistocene, it is now 
      restricted to Greenland and the Arctic Archipelago. In this study, we use ancient 
      DNA sequences, temporally unbiased summary statistics, and Bayesian analytical 
      techniques to infer musk ox population dynamics throughout the late Pleistocene 
      and Holocene. Our results reveal that musk ox genetic diversity was much higher 
      during the Pleistocene than at present, and has undergone several expansions and 
      contractions over the past 60,000 years. Northeast Siberia was of key importance, 
      as it was the geographic origin of all samples studied and held a large diverse 
      population until local extinction at approximately 45,000 radiocarbon years 
      before present ((14)C YBP). Subsequently, musk ox genetic diversity reincreased 
      at ca. 30,000 (14)C YBP, recontracted at ca. 18,000 (14)C YBP, and finally 
      recovered in the middle Holocene. The arrival of humans into relevant areas of 
      the musk ox range did not affect their mitochondrial diversity, and both musk ox 
      and humans expanded into Greenland concomitantly. Thus, their population dynamics 
      are better explained by a nonanthropogenic cause (for example, environmental 
      change), a hypothesis supported by historic observations on the sensitivity of 
      the species to both climatic warming and fluctuations.

AB  - Causes of late Quaternary extinctions of large mammals ("megafauna") continue to 
      be debated, especially for continental losses, because spatial and temporal 
      patterns of extinction are poorly known. Accurate latest appearance dates (LADs) 
      for such taxa are critical for interpreting the process of extinction. The 
      extinction of woolly mammoth and horse in northwestern North America is currently 
      placed at 15,000-13,000 calendar years before present (yr BP), based on LADs from 
      dating surveys of macrofossils (bones and teeth). Advantages of using 
      macrofossils to estimate when a species became extinct are offset, however, by 
      the improbability of finding and dating the remains of the last-surviving members 
      of populations that were restricted in numbers or confined to refugia. Here we 
      report an alternative approach to detect 'ghost ranges' of dwindling populations, 
      based on recovery of ancient DNA from perennially frozen and securely dated 
      sediments (sedaDNA). In such contexts, sedaDNA can reveal the molecular presence 
      of species that appear absent in the macrofossil record. We show that woolly 
      mammoth and horse persisted in interior Alaska until at least 10,500 yr BP, 
      several thousands of years later than indicated from macrofossil surveys. These 
      results contradict claims that Holocene survival of mammoths in Beringia was 
      restricted to ecologically isolated high-latitude islands. More importantly, our 
      finding that mammoth and horse overlapped with humans for several millennia in 
      the region where people initially entered the Americas challenges theories that 
      megafaunal extinction occurred within centuries of human arrival or were due to 
      an extraterrestrial impact in the late Pleistocene.

AB  - Although our knowledge of the genes and genomes of extinct organisms is improving 
      as a result of progress in sequencing ancient DNA, the transcriptomes of extinct 
      organisms remain inaccessible, owing to the rapid degradation of messenger RNA 
      after death. We provide empirical evidence that gene expression levels in the 
      reproductive tissues of mice and during early mouse development correlate highly 
      with the rate of inherited retroposition: the source of processed pseudogenes in 
      the genome. Thus, processed pseudogenes might serve as fossilized footprints of 
      the expression of their parent genes, shedding light on ancient transcriptomes 
      that could provide significant insights into the evolution of gene expression.

TI  - The evolutionary significance of ancient genome duplications.
PG  - 725-32
LID - 10.1038/nrg2600 [doi]
AB  - Many organisms are currently polyploid, or have a polyploid ancestry and now have 
      secondarily 'diploidized' genomes. This finding is surprising because retained 
      whole-genome duplications (WGDs) are exceedingly rare, suggesting that polyploidy 
      is usually an evolutionary dead end. We argue that ancient genome doublings could 
      probably have survived only under very specific conditions, but that, whenever 
      established, they might have had a pronounced impact on species diversification, 
      and led to an increase in biological complexity and the origin of evolutionary 
      novelties.

TI  - Genetic variation at hair length candidate genes in elephants and the extinct 
      woolly mammoth.
PG  - 232
LID - 10.1186/1471-2148-9-232 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Like humans, the living elephants are unusual among mammals in being 
      sparsely covered with hair. Relative to extant elephants, the extinct woolly 
      mammoth, Mammuthus primigenius, had a dense hair cover and extremely long hair, 
      which likely were adaptations to its subarctic habitat. The fibroblast growth 
      factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects hair length in a diverse set of mammalian species. 
      Mutations in FGF5 lead to recessive long hair phenotypes in mice, dogs, and cats; 
      and the gene has been implicated in hair length variation in rabbits. Thus, FGF5 
      represents a leading candidate gene for the phenotypic differences in hair length 
      notable between extant elephants and the woolly mammoth. We therefore sequenced 
      the three exons (except for the 3' UTR) and a portion of the promoter of FGF5 
      from the living elephantid species (Asian, African savanna and African forest 
      elephants) and, using protocols for ancient DNA, from a woolly mammoth. RESULTS: 
      Between the extant elephants and the mammoth, two single base substitutions were 
      observed in FGF5, neither of which alters the amino acid sequence. Modeling of 
      the protein structure suggests that the elephantid proteins fold similarly to the 
      human FGF5 protein. Bioinformatics analyses and DNA sequencing of another locus 
      that has been implicated in hair cover in humans, type I hair keratin pseudogene 
      (KRTHAP1), also yielded negative results. Interestingly, KRTHAP1 is a pseudogene 
      in elephantids as in humans (although fully functional in non-human primates). 
      CONCLUSION: The data suggest that the coding sequence of the FGF5 gene is not the 
      critical determinant of hair length differences among elephantids. The results 
      are discussed in the context of hairlessness among mammals and in terms of the 
      potential impact of large body size, subarctic conditions, and an aquatic 
      ancestor on hair cover in the Proboscidea.

TI  - An algebraic hypothesis about the primeval genetic code architecture.
PG  - 60-76
LID - 10.1016/j.mbs.2009.07.001 [doi]
AB  - A plausible architecture of an ancient genetic code is derived from an extended 
      base triplet vector space over the Galois field of the extended base alphabet 
      {D,A,C,G,U}, where symbol D represents one or more hypothetical bases with 
      unspecific pairings. We hypothesized that the high degeneration of a primeval 
      genetic code with five bases and the gradual origin and improvement of a primeval 
      DNA repair system could make possible the transition from ancient to modern 
      genetic codes. Our results suggest that the Watson-Crick base pairing G identical 
      with C and A=U and the non-specific base pairing of the hypothetical ancestral 
      base D used to define the sum and product operations are enough features to 
      determine the coding constraints of the primeval and the modern genetic code, as 
      well as, the transition from the former to the latter. Geometrical and algebraic 
      properties of this vector space reveal that the present codon assignment of the 
      standard genetic code could be induced from a primeval codon assignment. Besides, 
      the Fourier spectrum of the extended DNA genome sequences derived from the 
      multiple sequence alignment suggests that the called period-3 property of the 
      present coding DNA sequences could also exist in the ancient coding DNA 
      sequences. The phylogenetic analyses achieved with metrics defined in the 
      N-dimensional vector space (B(3))(N) of DNA sequences and with the new 
      evolutionary model presented here also suggest that an ancient DNA coding 
      sequence with five or more bases does not contradict the expected evolutionary 
      history.

TI  - Sequencing the nuclear genome of the extinct woolly mammoth.
PG  - 387-90
LID - 10.1038/nature07446 [doi]
AB  - In 1994, two independent groups extracted DNA from several Pleistocene epoch 
      mammoths and noted differences among individual specimens. Subsequently, DNA 
      sequences have been published for a number of extinct species. However, such 
      ancient DNA is often fragmented and damaged, and studies to date have typically 
      focused on short mitochondrial sequences, never yielding more than a fraction of 
      a per cent of any nuclear genome. Here we describe 4.17 billion bases (Gb) of 
      sequence from several mammoth specimens, 3.3 billion (80%) of which are from the 
      woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) genome and thus comprise an extensive set 
      of genome-wide sequence from an extinct species. Our data support earlier reports 
      that elephantid genomes exceed 4 Gb. The estimated divergence rate between 
      mammoth and African elephant is half of that between human and chimpanzee. The 
      observed number of nucleotide differences between two particular mammoths was 
      approximately one-eighth of that between one of them and the African elephant, 
      corresponding to a separation between the mammoths of 1.5-2.0 Myr. The estimated 
      probability that orthologous elephant and mammoth amino acids differ is 0.002, 
      corresponding to about one residue per protein. Differences were discovered 
      between mammoth and African elephant in amino-acid positions that are otherwise 
      invariant over several billion years of combined mammalian evolution. This study 
      shows that nuclear genome sequencing of extinct species can reveal population 
      differences not evident from the fossil record, and perhaps even discover genetic 
      factors that affect extinction.

TI  - In silico identification and analysis of new Artemis/Artemis-like sequences from 
      fungal and metazoan species.
PG  - 399-411
AB  - The Artemis Group comprises mammalian proteins with important functions in the 
      repair of ionizing radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks and in the cleavage 
      of DNA hairpin extremities generated during V(D)J recombination. Little is known 
      about the presence of Artemis/Artemis-like proteins in non-mammalian species. We 
      have characterized new Artemis/Artemis-like sequences from the genomes of some 
      fungi and from non-mammalian metazoan species. An in-depth phylogenetic analysis 
      of these new Artemis/Artemis-like sequences showed that they form a distinct 
      clade within the Pso2p/Snm1p A and B Groups. Hydrophobic cluster analysis and 
      three-dimensional modeling allowed to map and to compare conserved regions in 
      these Artemis/Artemis-like proteins. The results indicate that Artemis probably 
      belongs to an ancient DNA recombination mechanism that diversified with the 
      evolution of multi-cellular eukaryotic lineage.

TI  - Nomenclature of the ARID family of DNA-binding proteins.
PG  - 242-51
AB  - The ARID is an ancient DNA-binding domain that is conserved throughout the 
      evolution of higher eukaryotes. The ARID consensus sequence spans about 100 amino 
      acid residues, and structural studies identify the major groove contact site as a 
      modified helix-turn-helix motif. ARID-containing proteins exhibit a range of 
      cellular functions, including participation in chromatin remodeling, and 
      regulation of gene expression during cell growth, differentiation, and 
      development. A subset of ARID family proteins binds DNA specifically at AT-rich 
      sites; the remainder bind DNA nonspecifically. Orthologs to each of the seven 
      distinct subfamilies of mammalian ARID-containing proteins are found in insect 
      genomes, indicating the minimum age for the organization of these higher metazoan 
      subfamilies. Many of these ancestral genes were duplicated and fixed over time to 
      yield the 15 ARID-containing genes that are found in the human, mouse, and dog 
      genomes. This paper describes a nomenclature, recommended by the Mouse Genomic 
      Nomenclature Committee (MGNC) and accepted by the Human Genome Organization 
      (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee, for these mammalian ARID-containing genes 
      that reflects this evolutionary history.

TI  - Trypanosome telomeres are protected by a homologue of mammalian TRF2.
PG  - 5011-21
AB  - Putative TTAGGG repeat-binding factor (TRF) homologues in the genomes of 
      Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania major were identified. They 
      have significant sequence similarity to higher eukaryotic TRFs in their 
      C-terminal DNA-binding myb domains but only weak similarity in their N-terminal 
      domains. T. brucei TRF (tbTRF) is essential and was shown to bind to duplex 
      TTAGGG repeats. The RNA interference-mediated knockdown of tbTRF arrested 
      bloodstream cells at G(2)/M and procyclic cells partly at S phase. Functionally, 
      tbTRF resembles mammalian TRF2 more than TRF1, as knockdown diminished telomere 
      single-stranded G-overhang signals. This suggests that tbTRF, like vertebrate 
      TRF2, is essential for telomere end protection, and this also supports the 
      hypothesis that TRF rather than Rap1 is the more ancient DNA-binding component of 
      the telomere protein complex. Identification of the first T. brucei telomere 
      DNA-binding protein and characterization of its function provide a new route to 
      explore the roles of telomeres in pathogenesis of this organism. This work also 
      establishes T. brucei as an attractive model for telomere biology.

TI  - A real-time PCR protocol to determine the number of amelogenin (X-Y) gene copies 
      from forensic DNA samples.
PG  - 31-44
AB  - We present a fluorogenic real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure to 
      target a segment (106-112 base pairs [bp]) of the X-Y homologous amelogenin gene 
      by measuring the 5' nuclease activity of the Taq deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
      polymerase using two (X-Fam-labeled and Y-Vic-labeled) specific Taqman MGB probes 
      to enable simultaneous the detection of two specific PCR products (AMGY: 112-bp 
      and AMGX: 106 bp) as they accumulate cycle by cycle during PCR. The method makes 
      possible not only human nuclear DNA quantitation but also sex determination and 
      has been applied to the analysis of low copy number DNA samples in forensic and 
      ancient DNA studies. Specific quantification of human nuclear DNA is a 
      recommended procedure in forensic casework as a way to adjust the DNA input on 
      subsequent end-point PCR-based DNA typing approaches ensuring the optimal use of 
      the limited amounts of nuclear DNA found in many forensic evidences. Nuclear DNA 
      quantification also aids in the interpretation of the consistency of multiplex 
      STR profiling data obtained from low copy number DNA samples.

TI  - Different age distribution patterns of human, nematode, and Arabidopsis duplicate 
      genes.
PG  - 263-8
AB  - We studied the age distribution of duplicate genes in each of four eukaryotic 
      genomes: human, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila 
      melanogaster. The four distributions differ greatly from each other, contrary to 
      the previous proposal of a universal L-shaped distribution in all eukaryotic 
      genomes studied. Indeed, only the distribution in humans is L-shaped. The 
      distribution in Arabidopsis is consistent with the hypothesis of an ancient 
      genome duplication with no recent burst of duplication events, while the 
      distribution in C. elegans is nearly uniform. We also applied a nonparametric 
      method to the human distribution to show that the rate of loss of duplicate genes 
      decreases over time, contrary to the proposal of an exponential decay. One 
      possible explanation of the decreasing rate of loss of duplicate genes over time 
      could be rapid functional divergence between duplicate genes, providing an 
      advantage for the retention of both duplicates.

TI  - Intermedin, a novel calcitonin family peptide that exists in teleosts as well as 
      in mammals: a comparison with other calcitonin/intermedin family peptides in 
      vertebrates.
PG  - 1633-42
AB  - Endocrine regulation in vertebrates is critical for the adaptation and regulation 
      of homeostasis. The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling transduction 
      system represents one of the most ancient forms of cell surface signaling. 
      Recently, comparative sequence analysis has aided in the identification and 
      pairing of a variety of ligand/GPCR signaling systems. Among the ligands of type 
      II GPCRs, the calcitonin family peptides including calcitonin, alpha-calcitonin 
      gene-related peptide (alphaCGRP), betaCGRP, adrenomedullin, and amylin are among 
      the best studied hormones, and the founding member, calcitonin, was originally 
      identified and isolated from teleosts. This unique group of peptides shares a 
      conserved tertiary structure with an N-terminal disulfide-bridged ring. In 
      mammals, these peptides signal through two closely related type II GPCRs and 
      three unique receptor activity-modifying proteins. Recently, based on the 
      analysis of multiple vertebrate genomes, we identified a novel calcitonin/CGRP 
      family peptide named intermedin. Here we show that in humans the five paralogous 
      family genes, calcitonin, CGRP, amylin, adrenomedullin, and intermedin, evolved 
      before the emergence of modern vertebrates, and that teleost genomes carry 
      multiple copies of these co-evolved hormone genes. Sequence comparison showed 
      that each of these genes is highly conserved in different vertebrates and that 
      multiple copies of these peptides in teleosts could be derived from ancient 
      genome duplication and/or lineage-specific intragenic duplications. The present 
      article provides an overview of the calcitonin/intermedin family peptides found 
      in teleost and mammalian genomes, and describes their putative functions. In 
      addition, we demonstrate that one of the intermedin orthologs deduced from the 
      pufferfish (Fugu rubripes) genome shares a conserved signaling activity with 
      mammalian intermedin. The combined results indicate that the physiology 
      associated with each of these family peptides likely evolved during early 
      vertebrate evolution and diverged to serve select physiological functions in 
      different vertebrates.

TI  - Large-scale analysis of pseudogenes in the human genome.
PG  - 328-35
AB  - Pseudogenes are considered as genomic fossils: disabled copies of functional 
      genes that were once active in the ancient genome. Recently, whole-genome 
      computational approaches have revealed thousands of pseudogenes in the genomes of 
      the human and other eukaryotes. Identification of these pseudogenes can improve 
      the accuracy of gene annotation. It also offers new insight on the evolutionary 
      history and the stability of the genome as a whole.

TI  - Novel aspects of macromolecular repair and relationship to human disease.
PG  - 280-97
AB  - Cellular and humoral defence mechanisms are essential for the survival of 
      individuals and species. Thus, DNA repair prevents mutations and cytotoxicity 
      from DNA damage, thereby reducing the risks of inappropriate cell death, 
      developmental defects, premature ageing and cancer. Similarly, antigen-dependent 
      acquired immune responses prevent infections and also have a role in cancer 
      prevention. DNA repair is highly complex and functions in an intricate network 
      that also involves transcription, replication, cell cycle regulation, and the 
      immune system. DNA damage is repaired by at least four major mechanisms, each 
      requiring many different proteins. In addition there are "subpathways", and 
      back-up mechanisms both within and between pathways. Various defects in DNA 
      repair result in different forms of cancer, e.g. the rare syndrome Xeroderma 
      pigmentosum and the more common diseases early-onset breast cancer and hereditary 
      non-polyposis colon cancer. Surprisingly, recent research has revealed molecular 
      interactions between the ancient DNA repair mechanisms and the much younger 
      acquired immune system. Thus, the classical base excision enzyme uracil-DNA 
      glycosylase encoded by the UNG gene is also involved in somatic hypermutation and 
      class switch recombination, e.g. from IgM antibodies to IgG, yielding secreted 
      high affinity antibodies. Mutations in both alleles of UNG result in a hyper-IgM 
      syndrome with life-threatening infections. Furthermore, it has recently become 
      clear that not only DNA, but also RNA and proteins are repaired. Thus, certain 
      aberrant methylations in RNA are repaired by oxidative demethylation in one step 
      restoring the normal base, and at least in a bacterial model system this 
      increases survival several-fold after exposure to methylating agents. Proteins 
      are repaired both at the peptide amino acid level and at the structural level. 
      RNA and protein repair are likely to be important to prevent the formation of 
      cytotoxic protein aggregates of the types known to cause neurodegenerative 
      diseases e.g. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, and other 
      diseases as well. In conclusion, recent research has demonstrated an unexpected 
      complexity of cellular defence mechanisms that function in intricate networks, 
      rather than as independent mechanisms. The new knowledge opens for interventions 
      that are based on a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of defence.

TI  - The eukaryotic nucleotide excision repair pathway.
PG  - 1083-99
AB  - Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the most versatile mechanism of DNA repair, 
      recognizing and dealing with a variety of helix-distorting lesions, such as the 
      UV-induced photoproducts cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine 6-4 
      pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4 PPs). In this review, we describe the main protein 
      players and the different sequential steps of the eukaryotic NER mechanism in 
      human cells, from lesion recognition to damage removal and DNA synthesis. Studies 
      on the dynamics of protein access to the damaged site, and the kinetics of lesion 
      removal contribute to the knowledge of how the cells respond to genetic insult. 
      DNA lesions as well as NER factors themselves are also implicated in changes in 
      cell metabolism, influencing cell cycle progression or arrest, apoptosis and 
      genetic instability. These changes are related to increased mutagenesis and 
      carcinogenesis. Finally, the recent collection of genomic data allows one to 
      recognize the high conservation and the evolution of eukaryotic NER. The 
      distribution of NER orthologues in different organisms, from archaea to the 
      metazoa, displays challenging observations. Some of NER proteins are widespread 
      in nature, probably representing ancient DNA repair proteins, which are 
      candidates to participate in a primitive NER mechanism.

TI  - Rapid quantification and sex determination of forensic evidence materials.
PG  - 1280-7
AB  - DNA quantification of forensic evidence is very valuable for an optimal use of 
      the available biological material. Moreover, sex determination is of great 
      importance as additional information in criminal investigations as well as in 
      identification of missing persons, no suspect cases, and ancient DNA studies. 
      While routine forensic DNA analysis based on short tandem repeat markers includes 
      a marker for sex determination, analysis of samples containing scarce amounts of 
      DNA is often based on mitochondrial DNA, and sex determination is not performed. 
      In order to allow quantification and simultaneous sex determination on minute 
      amounts of DNA, an assay based on real-time PCR analysis of a marker within the 
      human amelogenin gene has been developed. The sex determination is based on 
      melting curve analysis, while an externally standardized kinetic analysis allows 
      quantification of the nuclear DNA copy number in the sample. This real-time DNA 
      quantification assay has proven to be highly sensitive, enabling quantification 
      of single DNA copies. Although certain limitations were apparent, the system is a 
      rapid, cost-effective, and flexible assay for analysis of forensic casework 
      samples.

TI  - Ancient DNA evidence for Old World origin of New World dogs.
PG  - 1613-6
AB  - Mitochondrial DNA sequences isolated from ancient dog remains from Latin America 
      and Alaska showed that native American dogs originated from multiple Old World 
      lineages of dogs that accompanied late Pleistocene humans across the Bering 
      Strait. One clade of dog sequences was unique to the New World, which is 
      consistent with a period of geographic isolation. This unique clade was absent 
      from a large sample of modern dogs, which implies that European colonists 
      systematically discouraged the breeding of native American dogs.

TI  - Extensive genomic duplication during early chordate evolution.
PG  - 200-4
AB  - Opinions on the hypothesis that ancient genome duplications contributed to the 
      vertebrate genome range from strong skepticism to strong credence. Previous 
      studies concentrated on small numbers of gene families or chromosomal regions 
      that might not have been representative of the whole genome, or used subjective 
      methods to identify paralogous genes and regions. Here we report a systematic and 
      objective analysis of the draft human genome sequence to identify paralogous 
      chromosomal regions (paralogons) formed during chordate evolution and to estimate 
      the ages of duplicate genes. We found that the human genome contains many more 
      paralogons than would be expected by chance. Molecular clock analysis of all 
      protein families in humans that have orthologs in the fly and nematode indicated 
      that a burst of gene duplication activity took place in the period 350 650 Myr 
      ago and that many of the duplicate genes formed at this time are located within 
      paralogons. Our results support the contention that many of the gene families in 
      vertebrates were formed or expanded by large-scale DNA duplications in an early 
      chordate. Considering the incompleteness of the sequence data and the antiquity 
      of the event, the results are compatible with at least one round of polyploidy.

TI  - Detection of bone glue treatment as a major source of contamination in ancient 
      DNA analyses.
PG  - 117-20
AB  - Paleogenetic investigations of ancient DNA extracted from fossil material is for 
      many reasons susceptible to falsification by the presence of more recent 
      contamination from several sources. Gelatine-based bone glue that has been used 
      extensively for nearly two centuries by curators to preserve hard tissues 
      contributes nonauthentic DNA to paleontological material. This fact has been 
      frequently neglected and is barely mentioned in the literature. Now 
      paleogeneticists, curators, and conservators are faced with the problem that 
      treatment of samples with adhesives and consolidants for conservatory purposes 
      has seldom been recorded. Here, we show that racemization of amino acids, and in 
      particular serine, is an excellent indicator for the treatment of paleontological 
      samples with glue.

TI  - Ancient duplications of the human proglucagon gene.
PG  - 741-6
AB  - The human proglucagon gene (GCG) is encoded within a finished 576-kb DNA sequence 
      generated by the Human Genome Project. GCG is flanked by 18 kb and 65 kb of DNA, 
      5' and 3', respectively, that do not encode genes. The genomic sequence that 
      includes GCG was found to have a long history of gene duplication events. Some 
      members of the glucagon-like family of genes, GCG on chromosome 2 and GIP on 
      chromosome 17, may be products of ancient genome duplications on the early 
      vertebrate lineage. A large genomic tandem duplication event that included 
      DPP4-like and GCG genes occurred before the amphibian-mammal divergence, but one 
      of the duplicated copies of GCG has been lost on the human lineage. Recently, a 
      processed pseudogene of the X-chromosome-linked gene TIMM8A was inserted 
      downstream of GCG. Some ancient duplicates of GCG may retain physiological 
      functions in other vertebrates.

TI  - Sequence analysis of measles virus strains collected during the pre- and 
      early-vaccination era in Denmark reveals a considerable diversity of ancient 
      strains.
PG  - 113-22
AB  - A total of 199 serum samples from patients with measles collected in Denmark, 
      Greenland and the Faroe Islands from 1964 to 1983 were analysed by PCR. Measles 
      virus (MV) RNA could be detected in 38 (19%) of the samples and a total of 18 
      strains were subjected to partial sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin gene. 
      The strains exhibited a considerable genomic diversity, which is at odds with the 
      assumption that one genome type prevailed among globally circulating MV strains 
      prior to the advent of live-attenuated vaccines. Our data indicate that the 
      similarity of the various vaccine strains is attributed to their having 
      originated from the same primary isolate. Consequently, it is implied that a 
      small number of clinical manifestations of MV worldwide from which strains 
      similar to the vaccine strain were identified were vaccine related rather than 
      being caused by members of a persistently circulating ancient genome type. The 
      Danish pre- and early-vaccination era MV strains seem to change the evolutionary 
      spectrum of genome types A, C2 and E into one coherent group, suggesting that the 
      genome types of MV strains circulating in the world at present do not represent 
      far ranging evolutionary lineages but merely members of an evolutionary continuum 
      of pre-vaccination era MV strains which by chance or due to an improved 
      capability survived the worldwide partial herd immunity accomplished through 
      vaccination.

TI  - Wanda: a database of duplicated fish genes.
PG  - 109-12
AB  - Comparative genomics has shown that ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) contain more 
      copies of many genes than other vertebrates. A large number of these additional 
      genes appear to have been produced during a genome duplication event that 
      occurred early during the evolution of Actinopterygii (i.e. before the teleost 
      radiation). In addition to this ancient genome duplication event, many lineages 
      within Actinopterygii have experienced more recent genome duplications. Here we 
      introduce a curated database named Wanda that lists groups of orthologous genes 
      with one copy from man, mouse and chicken, one or two from tetraploid Xenopus and 
      two or more ancient copies (i.e. paralogs) from ray-finned fish. The database 
      also contains the sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees that were necessary 
      for determining the correct orthologous and paralogous relationships among genes. 
      Where available, map positions and functional data are also reported. The Wanda 
      database should be of particular use to evolutionary and developmental biologists 
      who are interested in the evolutionary and functional divergence of genes after 
      duplication. Wanda is available at 
      http://www.evolutionsbiologie.uni-konstanz.de/Wanda/.

TI  - Comparative genomics provides evidence for an ancient genome duplication event in 
      fish.
PG  - 1661-79
AB  - There are approximately 25 000 species in the division Teleostei and most are 
      believed to have arisen during a relatively short period of time ca. 200 Myr ago. 
      The discovery of 'extra' Hox gene clusters in zebrafish (Danio rerio), medaka 
      (Oryzias latipes), and pufferfish (Fugu rubripes), has led to the hypothesis that 
      genome duplication provided the genetic raw material necessary for the teleost 
      radiation. We identified 27 groups of orthologous genes which included one gene 
      from man, mouse and chicken, one or two genes from tetraploid Xenopus and two 
      genes from zebrafish. A genome duplication in the ancestor of teleost fishes is 
      the most parsimonious explanation for the observations that for 15 of these 
      genes, the two zebrafish orthologues are sister sequences in phylogenies that 
      otherwise match the expected organismal tree, the zebrafish gene pairs appear to 
      have been formed at approximately the same time, and are unlinked. Phylogenies of 
      nine genes differ a little from the tree predicted by the fish-specific genome 
      duplication hypothesis: one tree shows a sister sequence relationship for the 
      zebrafish genes but differs slightly from the expected organismal tree and in 
      eight trees, one zebrafish gene is the sister sequence to a clade which includes 
      the second zebrafish gene and orthologues from Xenopus, chicken, mouse and man. 
      For these nine gene trees, deviations from the predictions of the fish-specific 
      genome duplication hypothesis are poorly supported. The two zebrafish orthologues 
      for each of the three remaining genes are tightly linked and are, therefore, 
      unlikely to have been formed during a genome duplication event. We estimated that 
      the unlinked duplicated zebrafish genes are between 300 and 450 Myr. Thus, genome 
      duplication could have provided the genetic raw material for teleost radiation. 
      Alternatively, the loss of different duplicates in different populations (i.e. 
      'divergent resolution') may have promoted speciation in ancient teleost 
      populations.

TI  - Forensic mitochondrial DNA analysis: two years of commercial casework experience 
      in the United States.
PG  - 298-303
AB  - AIM: To describe mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) forensic casework experience in a 
      commercial laboratory in the United States. METHODS: Frequency statistics were 
      kept for two years on all aspects of mtDNA forensic cases, including types of 
      clientele, types of samples, levels of sample success and failure, site 
      heteroplasmy, length heteroplasmy, contamination, rates of failures to exclude, 
      and match statistics using a mtDNA sequence database. RESULTS: Low sample failure 
      rate was observed, especially since an "ancient DNA" approach was used for 
      samples with degraded DNA. Levels of contamination were low, and the observed 
      site and length heteroplasmy did not confound the interpretation of results. The 
      data collected from mtDNA haplotypes developed in casework showed extremely high 
      diversity of haplotypes consistent with other formally developed databases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: MtDNA forensic analysis in the private sector was successfully 
      applied to many different types of samples overall, with minimal rates of 
      complication due to sample handling challenges (degraded DNA, minimal samples, 
      contamination) and sequence-specific phenomena (site and length heteroplasmy).

TI  - Ancient genome duplications did not structure the human Hox-bearing chromosomes.
PG  - 771-80
AB  - The fact that there are four homeobox (Hox) clusters in most vertebrates but only 
      one in invertebrates is often cited as evidence for the hypothesis that two 
      rounds of genome duplication by polyploidization occurred early in vertebrate 
      history. In addition, it has been observed in humans and other mammals that 
      numerous gene families include paralogs on two or more of the four Hox-bearing 
      chromosomes (the chromosomes bearing the Hox clusters; i.e., human chromosomes 2, 
      7, 12, and 17), and the existence of these paralogs has been taken as evidence 
      that these genes were duplicated along with the Hox clusters by polyploidization. 
      We tested this hypothesis by phylogenetic analysis of 42 gene families including 
      members on two or more of the human Hox-bearing chromosomes. In 32 of these 
      families there was evidence against the hypothesis that gene duplication occurred 
      simultaneously with duplication of the Hox clusters. Phylogenies of 14 families 
      supported the occurrence of one or more gene duplications before the origin of 
      vertebrates, and of 15 gene duplication times estimated for gene families 
      evolving in a clock-like manner, only six were dated to the same time period 
      early in vertebrate history during which the Hox clusters duplicated. 
      Furthermore, of gene families duplicated around the same time as the Hox 
      clusters, the majority showed topologies inconsistent with their having 
      duplicated simultaneously with the Hox clusters. The results thus indicate that 
      ancient events of genome duplication, if they occurred at all, did not play an 
      important role in structuring the mammalian Hox-bearing chromosomes.

TI  - Localization of mariner DNA transposons in the human genome by PRINS.
PG  - 839-43
AB  - Homologous recombination occurring among misaligned repeated sequences is a 
      significant source of the molecular rearrangements resulting in human genetic 
      disease. Studies of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease locus on chromosome 17 have 
      implicated the involvement of an ancient DNA transposon of the mariner family 
      (Hsmar2) in the initiation of double-strand break events leading to homologous 
      recombination. In this study, the genomic locations of 109 Hsmar2 elements were 
      determined by primed in situ labeling (PRINS) using primers designed to match the 
      right and left inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of the transposon. Although the 
      resolution of the PRINS technique is approximately 400 chromosomal Giemsa bands, 
      the data presented here provide the first large-scale mapping study of these 
      elements, which may be involved in initiation of homologous recombination events 
      in the human genome.

TI  - Multiplicity of glutamic acid decarboxylases (GAD) in vertebrates: molecular 
      phylogeny and evidence for a new GAD paralog.
PG  - 397-404
AB  - The evolution of chordate glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD; EC 4.1.1.15), a key 
      enzyme in the central nervous system synthesizing the neurotransmitter 
      gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) from glutamate, was studied. Prior to this study, 
      molecular data of GAD had been restricted to mammals, which express two distinct 
      forms, GAD65 and GAD67. These are the products of separate genes and probably are 
      derived from a common ancestral GAD following gene duplication at some point 
      during vertebrate evolution. To enable a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, 
      molecular information of GAD forms in other vertebrate classes was essential. By 
      reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), partial nucleotide 
      sequences of GAD were cloned from brains of zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), 
      turtle (Trachemys scripta), goldfish (Carassius auratus), zebrafish (Danio 
      rerio), and armoured grenadier (Coryphaenoides (Nematonurus) armatus, a deep-sea 
      fish), and from the cerebral ganglion plus neural gland of Ciona intestinalis, a 
      protochordate. Whereas GAD65 and GAD67 homologs were expressed in birds, 
      reptiles, and fish, only a single GAD cDNA with equal similarities to both 
      vertebrate GAD forms was found in the protochordate. This indicates that the 
      duplication of the vertebrate GAD gene occurred between 400 and 560 million years 
      ago. For both GAD65 and GAD67, the generated phylogenetic tree followed the 
      general tree topology for the major vertebrate classes. In turtle, an alternative 
      spliced form of GAD65, putatively encoding a truncated, nonactive GAD, was found. 
      Furthermore, a third GAD form, which is equally divergent from both GAD65 and 
      GAD67, is expressed in C. (N.) armatus. This third form might have originated 
      from an ancient genome duplication specific to modern ray-finned fishes.

TI  - Eukaryote genome duplication - where's the evidence?
PG  - 694-700
AB  - Several eukaryotes, including maize, yeast and Xenopus, are degenerate polyploids 
      formed by relatively recent whole-genome duplications. Ohno's conjecture that 
      more ancient genome duplications occurred in an ancestor of vertebrates is 
      probably at least partly true but the present shortage of gene sequence and map 
      information from vertebrates makes it difficult to either prove or disprove this 
      hypothesis. Candidate paralogous segments in mammalian genomes have been 
      identified but the lack of statistical rigour means that many of the proposals in 
      the literature are probably artefacts.

TI  - A genetic record of population isolation in pocket gophers during Holocene 
      climatic change.
PG  - 6893-6
AB  - A long-standing question in Quaternary paleontology is whether climate-induced, 
      population-level phenotypic change is a result of large-scale migration or 
      evolution in isolation. To directly measure genetic variation through time, 
      ancient DNA and morphologic variation was measured over 2,400 years in a Holocene 
      sequence of pocket gophers (Thomomys talpoides) from Lamar Cave, Yellowstone 
      National Park, Wyoming. Ancient specimens and modern samples collected near Lamar 
      Cave share mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences that are absent from adjacent 
      localities, suggesting that the population was isolated for the entire period. In 
      contrast, diastemal length, a morphologic character correlated with body size and 
      nutritional level, changed predictably in response to climatic change. Our 
      results demonstrate that small mammal populations can experience the long-term 
      isolation assumed by many theoretical models of microevolutionary change.

TI  - Proboscidean DNA from museum and fossil specimens: an assessment of ancient DNA 
      extraction and amplification techniques.
PG  - 165-79
AB  - Applications of reliable DNA extraction and amplification techniques to 
      postmortem samples are critical to ancient DNA research. Commonly used methods 
      for isolating DNA from ancient material were tested and compared using both soft 
      tissue and bones from fossil and contemporary museum proboscideans. DNAs isolated 
      using three principal methods served as templates in subsequent PCR 
      amplifications, and the PCR products were directly sequenced. Authentication of 
      the ancient origin of obtained nucleotide sequences was established by 
      demonstrating reproducibility under a blind testing system and by phylogenetic 
      analysis. Our results indicate that ancient samples may respond differently to 
      extraction buffers or purification procedures, and no single method was 
      universally successful. A CTAB buffer method, modified from plant DNA extraction 
      protocols, was found to have the highest success rate. Nested PCR was shown to be 
      a reliable approach to amplify ancient DNA templates that failed in primary 
      amplification.

TI  - Amino acid racemization and the preservation of ancient DNA.
PG  - 864-6
AB  - The extent of racemization of aspartic acid, alanine, and leucine provides 
      criteria for assessing whether ancient tissue samples contain endogenous DNA. In 
      samples in which the D/L ratio of aspartic acid exceeds 0.08, ancient DNA 
      sequences could not be retrieved. Paleontological finds from which DNA sequences 
      purportedly millions of years old have been reported show extensive racemization, 
      and the amino acids present are mainly contaminates. An exception is the amino 
      acids in some insects preserved in amber.

TI  - Carrier detection of Duchenne muscular dystrophy through analysis of DNA from 
      deciduous teeth of a dead affected child.
PG  - 672-4
AB  - The sister of a child affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) was referred 
      for genetic counselling to assess the risk of her being a carrier. Her brother 
      had died 15 years previously at the age of 8. There were no other affected males 
      in the family. There were no methods for DNA investigation at the time of the 
      child's death and the family had never been studied for linkage with polymorphic 
      probes on the chromosomal region Xp21. The only tissue from which an assessment 
      of the risk could be made by DNA linkage analysis was two of the child's 
      deciduous teeth that the parents had kept. DNA was extracted using a protocol 
      described for the recovery of ancient DNA from museum specimens and 
      archaeological finds. Multiplex amplification did not reveal deletions in 19 
      exons spanning the hot-spot regions for deletions within the dystrophin gene in 
      Xp21. Linkage analysis using three highly polymorphic microsatellites 
      demonstrated that the sister had not received the X chromosome borne by her 
      brother. These results show that DNA extracted from teeth is a reliable source 
      for molecular diagnosis.

TI  - Nuclear counterparts of the cytoplasmic mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene: a problem of 
      ancient DNA and molecular phylogenies.
PG  - 652-7
AB  - Monkey mummy bones and teeth originating from the North Saqqara Baboon Galleries 
      (Egypt), soft tissue from a mummified baboon in a museum collection, and 
      nineteenth/twentieth-century skin fragments from mangabeys were used for DNA 
      extraction and PCR amplification of part of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. 
      Sequences aligning with the 12S rRNA gene were recovered but were only distantly 
      related to contemporary monkey mitochondrial 12S rRNA sequences. However, many of 
      these sequences were identical or closely related to human nuclear DNA sequences 
      resembling mitochondrial 12S rRNA (isolated from a cell line depleted in 
      mitochondria) and therefore have to be considered contamination. Subsequently in 
      a separate study we were able to recover genuine mitochondrial 12S rRNA sequences 
      from many extant species of nonhuman Old World primates and sequences closely 
      resembling the human nuclear integrations. Analysis of all sequences by the 
      neighbor-joining (NJ) method indicated that mitochondrial DNA sequences and their 
      nuclear counterparts can be divided into two distinct clusters. One cluster 
      contained all temporary cytoplasmic mitochondrial DNA sequences and approximately 
      half of the monkey nuclear mitochondriallike sequences. A second cluster 
      contained most human nuclear sequences and the other half of monkey nuclear 
      sequences with a separate branch leading to human and gorilla mitochondrial and 
      nuclear sequences. Sequences recovered from ancient materials were equally 
      divided between the two clusters. These results constitute a warning for when 
      working with ancient DNA or performing phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial 
      DNA as a target sequence: Nuclear counterparts of mitochondrial genes may lead to 
      faulty interpretation of results.

PG  - 1043-51
AB  - The purpose of this review is to discuss critically the practical meaning of a 
      specific genome component, simple repetitive desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
      sequences as clinical and forensic and diagnostic and research tools. Previously, 
      multilocus DNA fingerprinting was the major technology employed to visualize such 
      simple repeat sequences. This technique enables many polymorphic loci to be 
      simultaneously detected thus yielding vast amounts of information. With the 
      advent of enzymatic DNA amplification via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 
      individual simple repeat loci can be demonstrated, theoretically even from single 
      DNA molecules and so a wealth of additional approaches have also become feasible. 
      In general investigating, small, known, single copy parts of genomes have not 
      posed truly insurmountable problems if enough material was available. There have 
      even been a few (anecdotal) reports on the amplification of simple repeats from 
      ancient DNA (see, e.g. [30]. Here we would like to after a solid basis for an 
      earnest discussion of the applications of these simple repetitive sequences using 
      various methodological approaches relevant for clinical diagnosis, setting aside 
      the obvious unsolved mysteries of their biology.
